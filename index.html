            Flatterline is the best development studio I have ever used, hands down.
            The code is clean, scales well, is delivered on time and with style.
            Highly recommend them!

            I've worked with many product development teams... and I can say definitively
            that the Flatterline team is one of the best around. Their technical abilities
            are first class... they look beyond the technical aspects of the project to
            ensure that the user experience and business objectives are achieved....

            Flatterline is more than a development firm, they are a trusted resource for us.
