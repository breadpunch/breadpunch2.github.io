  <h1>HyLo</h1>
  <p><p>HyLo is a real-time, location-based advertising platform with custom web widgets that can be tied into any website or mobile device.</p>

<p>The platform is currently being used by college media, local business organizations, publications and public radio stations.</p></p>

  <h3>What we did for HyLo:</h3>
  <p>Flatterline was responsible for the entire application lifecycle. We worked closely with the founders of HyLo to gather and manage requirements; develop the core platform, API and web-based widgets; and played a key role in presenting the technological perspective in meetings with shareholders, potential investors and partners.</p>

    <h3>What HyLo had to say about Flatterline:</h3>

    
      <blockquote>
        <p>Flatterline has been an absolute pleasure to work with over the last year and a half. They use their development expertise to bring tremendous ideas to the table that will help further a company along, not just to "get the job done."</p>

<p>I would highly recommend Flatterline to anyone looking to ensure their technology will be deployed efficiently, on-time, and in line with the company goals. I would be happy to speak directly to anyone who would like additional information about the high quality of their work. <a class='value' href='tel:+16029035972'>602.903.5972</a>.</p>
        <small>Mike Gagnon, CEO</small>
      </blockquote>
    
      <blockquote>
        <p>Flatterline is more than a development firm, they are a trusted resource for us. When we hired Flatterline we expected great things but we got so much more. As with every startup, you sometimes create impossible situations yet the Flatterline team was able to take each challenge and deliver. They continually communicated with us so that we were always on the same page concerning the direction of my startup. It's that kind of concern and dedication that I look forward to working with Flatterline for many years.</p>
        <small>Aaron Post, CMO</small>
      </blockquote>
    
      <blockquote>
        <p>I worked with the Flatterline team on Humshakal.com and Hylo. I've worked with many product development teams, both internal and external, and I can say definitively that the Flatterline team is one of the best around.</p>

<p>Their technical abilities are first class and they are strong communicators. And probably most importantly, they look beyond the technical aspects of the project to ensure that the user experience and business objectives are achieved in the product.</p>
        <small>Robert Wallace, Founder, CEO at Katallaxy</small>
      </blockquote>
    
      <blockquote>
        <p>As a founder of and advisor to numerous software startups, I can attest to the value of Flatterline for Rails Development. Emerging, early stage companies need developers that combine vision, innovative thinking, creativity, velocity and a strong work ethic. If your company is in need of development support, Flatterline is a no-brainer.</p>
        <small>Anil Jain, Shareholder/Advisor</small>
