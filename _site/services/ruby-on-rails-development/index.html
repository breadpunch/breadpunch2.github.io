    <h1>Ruby on Rails Development</h1>

<p>At our core, we're Ruby on Rails Developers.</p>

<h2>Agile Development</h2>

<p>First, we start with a story workshop, where we'll explore every idea and concept you have for the web application.</p>

<p>In the story workshop, we break down each idea into manageable "stories" about what you want the application to do, or how you want clients, customers, or employees to interact with it.</p>

<p>Then we prioritize all those stories. You see, if we develop <i>all</i> the stories, it might take 2 years to complete. (Hey, if you have the money to wait 2 years while we develop your custom app, by all means, stop reading this and just <a href="/contact/">hire us</a>).</p>

<p>But if you're anything like the 99% of clients we work with, you need it up and running faster than that. You might be interested to know that our first iteration (think of it as a first draft) is usually 6-8 weeks. Of course, it doesn't include every story, only the most important ones. That's what allows us to get up and running so fast. But now comes the fun part...</p>

<p>Now that your users are interacting with the app, they're going to give you feedback. And chances are, you're going to recognize some false assumptions you made initially. So it's a good thing we didn't just put our heads down and code the whole thing, cause now we'll be able to set off in new directions we maybe didn't even know about before. And we'll be able to release new functionality on a quicker timetable than the first iteration.</p>

<h2>Why Testing is Important</h2>

<p>Imagine you just dropped $50K on a web app and you need a new function added. Your developer codes it, pastes it in...and...</p>

<p>Your app breaks...</p>

<p>Well, not if we were coding it, because we start with a test-first approach. Before we ever start coding your app, we actual establish a set of tests that show us the app is performing the way its suppose to. The intial test actually fails because no code has been written yet. As we write the code, each test goes from a red light (failure) to a green light (success).</p>

<p>At any time in the future, when you want additional features built out, the developer you use will be able to utilize these tests to determine if code that has been added 'breaks' the app (red light). This is part of our Ruby on Rails coding best practices. And it assures you have a high-quality app with very few errors.</p>

<p>Of course, other developers have different ways of doing things, so let's talk about that a bit...</p>
