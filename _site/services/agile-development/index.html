  <h1>Our Agile Development Process</h1>

<p>In prehistoric times, you would submit an app idea to a developer.
He'd put his head down and go to work coding. Three months later, he'd
give you your app and you'd respond with, "What the hell is this?"
Cause the idea in your mind isn't anything close to what you received.</p>

<p>I don't know why anyone would choose to develop this way, but if you
talk to other developers about your project, you're sure to run across
a few who still think like this. Of course, that's NOT how we do
things here...</p>

<p>Taking an idea you have and creating it into an app is an art; an art
we excell at. You see, it's all about the communication process, and
how we translate your ideas into a living, breathing app. The name for
how we do this is: AGILE.</p>

<p>Using agile development methodologies means we adjust to change
quickly to create the best product within the time frame and budget
alloted. Think of it like a boxer always being on his toes; if you
come at the project with a jab, but based on cusomer feedback, realize
you need to quickly throw a hook, our agile development strategies
allow you to land the punch. And sometimes even two or three for the
knockout...</p>

<p>Seriously, you'll be amazed at how much you're going to learn about
your business, and your customers, as you go through the development
process with us. We're not just going to put our heads down and start
coding your app. In fact, it's just the opposite, so let's talk a
little bit about that....</p>

<h2>The Story Workshop Process</h2>

<p>First, we start with a story workshop, where we'll explore every idea
and concept you have for the web application.</p>

<p>In the story workshop, we break down each idea into manageable
"stories" about what you want the application to do, or how you want
clients, customers, or employees to interact with it.</p>

<p>Then we prioritize all those stories. You see, if we develop
<i>all</i> the stories, it might take 2 years to complete. (Hey, if
you have the money to wait 2 years while we develop your custom app,
by all means, stop reading this and just <a href="/contact/">hire
us</a>).</p>

<p>But if you're anything like the 99% of clients we work with, you need
it up and running faster than that. You might be interested to know
that our first iteration (think of it as a first draft) is usually 6-8
weeks. Of course, it doesn't include every story, only the most
important ones. That's what allows us to get up and running so fast.
But now comes the fun part...</p>

<p>Now that your users are interacting with the app, they're going to
give you feedback. And chances are, you're going to recognize some
false assumptions you made initially. So it's a good thing we didn't
just put our heads down and code the whole thing, cause now we'll be
able to set off in new directions we maybe didn't even know about
before. And we'll be able to release new functionality on a quicker
timetable than the first iteration.</p>


<h2>Why We Take a Test-first Approach</h2>

<p>Imagine you just dropped $50K on a web app and you need a new function
added. Your developer codes it, pastes it in...and...</p>

<p>Your app breaks...</p>

<p>Well, not if we were coding it, because we start with a test-first
approach. Before we ever start coding your app, we actual establish a
set of tests that show us the app is performing the way its suppose
to. The intial test actually fails because no code has been written
yet. As we write the code, each test goes from a red light (failure)
to a green light (success).</p>

<p>At any time in the future, when you want additional features built
out, the developer you use will be able to utilize these tests to
determine if code that has been added 'breaks' the app (red light).
This is part of our Ruby on Rails coding best practices. And it
assures you have a high-quality app with very few errors.</p>

<p>Of course, other developers have different ways of doing things, so
let's talk about that a bit...</p>



<h2>Choosing a Custom Web Application Developer</h2>

<p>Do you remember the boxer we were talking about early. Okay, here's
how some other developers do things. The bell rings and they throw
everything they've got at the guy, regardless of what he's doing,
hoping something will land. It's disorganized chaos and there's no
synergy for landing the finishing blow.</p>

<p>What's worse is after the first round, they've got nothing left, and
there's still 11 more rounds to go. You can read that as, they develop
everything at once, in a disorganized way, and they don't communicate
with you about the resutls. In the end, you have an app that doesn't
do what you want and no money to make adjustments. Trust us, you don't
want to end up like that...</p>

<p>Of course, we want you to choose us to develop your app, but we're not
completely naive, we know you're shopping around. In fact, we want you
to shop around. But we want you to do it knowledgably, so you can
compare apples to oranges (hmmm, are we the apples, or the oranges?).</p>

<p>Because we've gone through this process with so many clients, we have
a good idea of the difficulties you face. Not only are you depending
on us to develop a high quality application with code that's been
tested free of errors, but you're also relying on the application we
create to help the success of your business.  Phew...that's a lot of
pressure...</p>

<p>I wish we could pull back the face of our client's websites and let
you see what's running underneath the surface. Beacuse really, we're
not a design company. People don't come to us to make things pretty.
What we do is the business logic behind your product or service. It's
the process running behind the visual. Things like how a request is
processed, who can access information and the enforcement of specific
rules you need to make the app work in the most perfect way.</p>

<p>Of course, we could show you some of our code, but what would that
mean to you. So you have to rely upon our word that our mad
programming skillz are better than those other guys, and we're certain
they are. You, on the otherhand, may not be so certain. But to help
you, we created this white paper: Top Ten Questions You Should Be
Asking Your Web Application Developer</p>

<p>Download it, print it off, sleep with it under your pillow. But
whatever you do, make sure you read it, and use the questions when
you're shopping around. It'll be our secret *wink, wink*. Now, what's
next...?</p>
