<p>At Flatterline, our stated mission is to help startups realize their vision. To that end, we've decided to help bring <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/15697/">OpenCoffee Club to Phoenix</a>.</p>

<h3>What is OpenCoffee Club?</h3>

<p>OpenCoffee Club is a weekly gathering of entrepreneurs and investors in an informal setting (a.k.a, a coffee shop). The goal is to bring these entrepreneurs and investors together to talk about projects, collaborate and get to know each other.</p>

<p>It was originally started in London by <a href="http://www.indexventures.com/team#profile_id_10">Saul Klein, a venture partner at Index Ventures</a>. Since then, over 80 OpenCoffee Clubs have sprung up worldwide. You can read more about it on <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html">Saul's blog</a> or at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_open_coffee_club_movement.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>On a recent trip to Boulder, CO I attended an OpenCoffee Club facilitated by <a href="http://www.askthevc.com/blog/">Jason Mendelson</a> of the <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/">Foundry Group</a>. It was really inspiring to see such a vibrant startup community meeting regularly to discuss ideas, share problems, give advice and, most of all, listen to each other.</p>

<p>We believe that Phoenix has a lot of talented, entrepreneurial people. We want them to have the best chance to grow and succeed and this is one small way we see that happening.</p>

<p>The first meetup will be on Thursday, April 30 from 8am - 10am at Fair Trade Coffee. <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2473241/">Please let us know you're coming</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In what other ways can we help the Phoenix startup community thrive?</strong></p>
