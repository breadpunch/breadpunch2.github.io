<p>Just about everything is finally underway here at Flatterline! We've finished our first full month of activity and we've been having a blast while we've been doing it.I need to say this to the entire community and everyone we've talked with:</p>

<h3>Thank You! Thank you for the support, the referrals, the chats, and everything else!</h3>

<p>In the last month we have been approached by numerous individuals and companies who have been searching for developers. They all said they were referred to us by people in the community that had favorable past experiences with us or because they have worked with us directly. I cannot even begin to say what a compliment it is that no sooner did we form a company that people are already being referred to us.</p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> downside to all of these referrals is that we simply cannot take on all these clients. Curtis and I fundamentally believe, and agree, that we are not in any rush to grow or take on more clients than we believe we can handle at any given time. That being said, we absolutely believe in referring potential clients to people who do have the capacity and availability for more work. If your a development shop we will happily try and pair you with the awesome clients that we don't have the capacity for right now.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal is a win-win for clients and other developers. We want our potential clients to know that we value their time and future success, and sometimes that future success means hitting the ground running immediately with other developers in the community.</p>
