Looks like it's almost time for <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/">Desert Code Camp</a> again! What is this event, you ask? From their site:

<blockquote>"Code Camps have been taking place all over the country.  This is a free, one-day event put on by the local Phoenix community to help promote software development in general.  There is no right or wrong language, platform, or technology.  If a topic relates in any way to the code that causes a machine to produce a desired result, it's welcome here."</blockquote>

This year it will be held at the <a href="http://www.devry.edu/locations/campuses/loc_phoenixcampus.jsp">DeVry University Phoenix Campus</a> and is once again being organized by <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/lorint/Default.aspx">Lorin Thwaits</a>.

Flatterline will be teaching two sessions this year in the 21st Century Software Development track: <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=495">Developing with CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=477">Understanding functional programming</a>.

The schedule became available today, so if you haven't registered do so now and build your schedule for Saturday. It looks like there are a lot of great sessions this year and we can't wait to learn from all of our colleagues. See you there!
