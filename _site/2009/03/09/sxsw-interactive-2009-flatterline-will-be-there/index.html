<p>That's right, folks, both <a href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> and <a href="http://millarian.com">Curtis Miller</a> will be hitting up SXSW this year in Austin. We arrive Thursday night and leave Tuesday night. Unfortunately, we made our plans when we still worked for someone else, so we tried to minimize time off from work... boo!</p>
