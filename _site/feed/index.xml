      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jenny Poon--a woman who admittedly likes to tell people hell no, makes little children cry and says the best part of being a busines owner is, &quot;I'm the BOSS!&quot; But she won't spit in your hair, she'll admit her faults, and she'll go out of her way to make your day. She's won several design awards, but for her, it's not about the design...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the University of Minnesota for advertising and journalism. Although I like writing and I like understanding the advertising industry, I still wasn't able to do what I love, which is design. So I went to design school, but by my second year, teachers were asking me how to do things, and I asked myself, &quot;Why am I paying $4000 a semester to teach a class?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I don't recommend people dropping out of school, ever...but it was the best decision for me&quot;&gt;
So I stopped that and got an internship to do design work. I don't recommend people dropping out of school, ever...but it was the best decision for me, because I learned more at my internship than I ever did at school.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you do after that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for quite a few different magazines. It was great seeing how businesses work. But I got to the point where I was happy with my design work, but I hated the companies I was working for. Day after day, my anger grew. I would make suggestions, and it wasn't anything they were excited about. So I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Arizona Republic. I was art director of their local magazine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azcentral.com/style/azmag/azmagdex.html&quot;&gt;AZ Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. It was great because I got to meet entrepreneurs and small business people while learning about Phoenix, which really got me excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you know you wanted to start your own business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I love running my own business!&quot;&gt;
I remember growing up thinking, &quot;I'll never be in a job I really love, cause that just doesn't happen.&quot; Kids grow up thinking that. They say, &quot;I'm going to be a doctor because everyone says I should be a doctor.&quot; And they think about how they're going to work for somebody else. I think you have to work for somebody, so you know how to run your own business. I love running my own business!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents own a busines. They've run their own business for a really long time...since I was born. I had to work in the restaurant and I had to go work in the restaurant every day after shcool. I remember thinking, &quot;This is terrible. My parents are always at work and I always have to be there helping. I never want to run my own business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends would ask, &quot;Do you want to run a business when you get older?&quot; and I'd say, &quot;No! That's a 24/7 job for the rest of your life. When you take a vacation, it's not really a vacation cause you're getting docked pay for not working.&quot; So I was very much against it. But then you start working for other people, and you realize maybe you're crazy and selfish and there are things you want to do your way, and you don't like doing things that don't have an effect on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's how I felt, so I decided to start my own business...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn't a restaurant, so I still take vacations, and I work from home when I want to. I&quot;M THE BOSS! It's scary going off on your own, but I was lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eekostudio.com/&quot;&gt;Ecco Studio&lt;/a&gt; grew out of one of those things I was passionate about: sustainability. I see the benefit in solar and being more sustainabe, so I thought, &quot;How can I help them with their cause?&quot; I started searching out sustainable companies and hearing their stories, and learning about what they do. The ones that won me over were the ones I ended up working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's what Ecco ended up being about--finding clients and things to do that I'm passionate about. Anything that needs design help. Good ideas need good help. Ecco Studio has made a name out of helping small businesses brand themselves. We do logos, print advertising, web design, online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you market your business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been really fortunate to not have to do much marketing. From the time I launched Ecco Studios, I had clients waiting to work with me. So when I launched, I had a flurry of work. It was great, but in the back of my head, I was always nervous about where my next paycheck was coming from. Am i going to pay the bills in six months? I always have 6-8 months leeway on everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I love being in this community of people that are passionate about everything they're doing.&quot;&gt;
I love being in this community of people that are passionate about everything they're doing. So I asked, &quot;How do I continue that?&quot; The answer was by working with clients who are passionate about what they do.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What cool things can we do that maybe don't raise a lot of revenue, that opens all these ideas out. Hopefully that leads to bigger products. Big agencies are impersonal. A lot of stuff that comes out of agencies has been done and done and done again. I'm really big on keeping our team and creativeity fresh. We have the time to focus on you and focus on developing ideas, cauase they're like us; passionate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of collaborators. That's how Co+hoots works. You work together with other people that are really strong in other skill sets and focus on your own skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more about Co+Hoots, collaboration, and coworking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;When people see what we're doing, they see it's really different.&quot;&gt;
At first, I was working from home and I was doing great. But as I was growing and hiring on people, I knew it just wasn't going to work from home. Meeting at coffee shops just wasn't going to work either. I talked to a few people and looked into sharing space, just for the sake of small business and not taking crazy risks. So we looked at a few spaces, ran the numbers and it seemed to work. If everyone pitched in, we could pay the rent, pay for a few supplies, and everyone could focus on their business and not worry about where they were working out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That turned into Co+Hoots, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cohoots.com&quot;&gt;coworking space in downtown Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave it a try and its been successful. It's kinda magical...but honestly, the concept isn't hard to sell, expecially for the people who understand coworking and are looking for it. When people see what we're doing, they see it's really different.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me an example of how collaboration works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always been the art designer and creative director; I've never been the business side person. I can do it, but its not what I'm passionate about. So I don't really want to do it. So I hand that over to one of my collaborators and I'm good. We're all working together, side by side, in the same space. So there's not as much miscommunication as you might have with a distributed team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you fund your startup business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate, because I knew that I wanted to do this before I left my job, so I had time to prepare and a good cushion. It was in the back of my mind; I was mentally prepared for it. It was really exciting, and the hardest work I've ever done. So I loved doing it. I had money set aside, about 6-8 months, and I already had a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the biggest mistake you've made?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking I could do it all by myself. I learned quickly that it's okay to ask for help. People really like being asked to help other people. It gives them a level of respect and increases their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;It's not about competing, it's about producing a good quality product. If you create a quality product, there's no way to compete.&quot;&gt;
Try to think of it as not everyone's your competitor, but everyone's someone who could possibly help you. Tell me how I can help you, and here's what I need help with.  It's not about competing, it's about producing a good quality product. If you create a quality product, there's no way to compete.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always ask myself, &quot;How can I get really excited about this project that I'm working on?&quot; And then it flows...and if we're not excited about doing something, I can always pass it off to someone else who's a better fit...one of our collaborators at Co+Hoots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's been the most important thing you've learned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;If there's any red flag that goes up at any point, then don't just say no, say hell no.&quot;&gt;
Knowing my worth and knowing when to say no. I read this book called Hell No! If there's any red flag that goes up at any point, then don't just say no, say hell no. There are plenty of people who will take up the project, and if you take it on, then you know you'll be kicking yourself later. So its okay if we starve for a day or two until we get a good project...but that hasn't happened yet &lt;strong&gt;knocks on wood&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the best marketing you've done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.localfirstaz.com/&quot;&gt;Local First Arizona&lt;/a&gt; was huge! Because it's right along side what I believe in--working with people that are passionate about what they're doing, working with local businesses, helping improve connectins between small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next best thing was doing good work and having good client relationships, because those always spin off to more work. When you're working with a client, you need to make sure you're on your best behavior. Its simple things like being polite, respectful, don't spit in anyone's hair...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do when a client isn't on their best behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It alway needs to be equal balance. The client has to hold up their end of the deal and if they're not, you have to stand your ground. That goes back to knowing your worth. If someone's stepping on you, you have to put your foot down and sometimes it's just not going to work out, because you're a different personality or there's different expectations. That's okay, that comes with every single business. We've had to fire a few clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you set expectations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a strong believer in being harsh in the beginning. I learned that from being a teacher. You have to be a bitch and set the ground rules right at the get-go. Then there's no surprises in the future. What I did when I was a teacher is be really stern, you know, make kids cry, lay down the law, then the rest of it is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just make it very clear from the beginning, here are all our expectations, all our deliverables, all our deadlines. If you're honest with people, they'll understand it. Admiting that you have faults, people are willing to help you overcome them. You tell them, this is what you're going to get from me, this is what I'm going to get from you, and then you over deliver, and they'll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surround your pullquote like this {&quot; text to be quoted &quot;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that means I think of a cool promotional item I think you should do, and I don't tell you about it and I just do it and give it to you, and it makes your day, then hell yeah! I think that's just being a good person. What would you do for your brother or sister? That's what you should be doing for your client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you offer someone starting their own business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's okay to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stay focused on what you're passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't give your boss the finger on your way out the door as you're going to do your startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and you can be happy at your job! It is possible! You can do this and be happy at your job. It's going to be hard work and you better be driven to do it, but you CAN do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Brian Webster's a one-man-show, who's done everything right without maybe even intending to. What's his secret? He attributes his success to making a quality product and responding well to customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your company. How did you get started?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently a one-man software company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fatcatsoftware.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fat Cat Software&lt;/a&gt;. I do programming for Mac OS X. I have three applications that I sell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/&quot;&gt;iPhoto Library Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/powertunes/&quot;&gt;PowerTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/plisteditpro/&quot;&gt;PlistEdit Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I had some grand plan like I'm going to start my own business, but it really just kinda happened...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPhoto Library Manager originally started out as a programming project to teach myself Mac OS X programming. iPhoto had just come out when I graduated from college, and I hadn't found a job yet, so I had a lot of free time on my hands. I wrote this little program that would allow people to switch between libraries, because iPhoto only allows for one library. I did it as freeware and Apple updated a year later and I did an update and still remained free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;Eventually I said, what the heck, I'll try charging $20 for it, and it just kinda took off.&quot;&gt;
As time went along, I got email, and people asking to be able to do other things. Eventually, it was a combination of me getting enough of these emails and iPhoto expanding its capabilities.  At that time I was working for a Mac development company for a couple years. My then girlfriend, now wife, was up in grad school, and I had plenty of free time in the evenings; basically I had no life. I'd go to my job and program all day, then I'd come home and work on my own programming. I was just kinda plunking away on it as a side project.  Eventually I said, what the heck, I'll try charging $20 for it, and it just kinda took off. Lots of people needed it; lots of people liked it. Within about a year, I was making as much for that as I was from my current job. Once it got to that point, I decide to transition over and do that full time. And I've been doing it ever since.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did you get the idea from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the irony of the whole thing; I'm not into photography at all. My wife is, but my own photo collection is not much, so she gathers test data for me to work on. Initially it was just a fun project to teach myself. But it's been a lot of fun and its turned into a useful, troubleshooting tool for people using iPhoto. Users keep me pretty aware of breaking iPhoto issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I allowed user feedback to influence the development of my next product.&quot;&gt;
Once I had Library Manager out there a common question was do you have something for iTunes library management. So I allowed user feedback to influence the development of my next product. I wanted to diversify a little bit, since there's always the possibility with one product that Apple could add everything I do into their next release. It's always a possibility, but it's been nine years and it hasn't happened yet. I think they don't want to add too much to iPhoto because it would compete with their professional photo software, Aperture.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did having one successful project under your belt help you with your next product launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, both in terms of programming the app and marketing it. I was able to reuse the concepts and code from the previous app, as well as the whole process of putting up a website and offering it for sale in an online store. Plus I learned from all my previous mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you market your app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I haven't done a whole lot of marketing in the traditional sense.&quot;&gt;
I haven't done a whole lot of marketing in the traditional sense. For people with corrupted iPhoto libraries, I get a fair portion of my traffic that comes directly from Apple's own discussion forums, where there are users helping each other. There are 2-3 regular users who will help a lot of people with iPhoto stuff, and for a lot of common iPhoto problems, they say, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Go try iPhoto Library Manager.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have quite a few reviews, including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/53474/2006/10/iphotolibrarymanager.html&quot;&gt;review for iPhoto Library Manager on MacWorld&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, it always helps when those reviews are positive, 4.5 mice or whatever rating scale they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there's enough juice behind my product name that if you start to type iPhoto, Google will give you a suggestion for iPhoto Library Manager. It's a keyword that gets over 20,000 searches each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you transition to a paid model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little worried whether there would be backlash, so what I ended up doing was making sure everything you could do in the free version of the software you could still do for free in the updated version and it was just the new features you had to pay to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go back and forth on the best way to do trial limitations for software, because you have to have something in there. PowerTunes is time-limited, so it's fully featured but after 30 days it locks down and you have to pay. Whereas with iPhoto Library Manager there's no time limit. It's just if you want to do X, Y or Z you have to pay. I'm not a huge fan of that model, but it seems to work pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you sell your app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by selling everything through my own online store. For that I use Potion Store, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore&quot;&gt;open source Ruby on Rails web store&lt;/a&gt;. It's on GitHub, and I'm not Rails expert, but I was able to learn enough to make the change and updates I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not sell through the Mac App Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started, the app store didn't exist. And of course, the Mac app store has guidelines for what apps in the store are allowed to do. I fall outside of those guidelines. So I've never tried to sell there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the curve for the number of users for my app has gone up over time. Apple's selling more and more computers with people using iPhoto. As their user base grows, my customer base grows too. I'm in a really good situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you spend your day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;Writing code is a big part of the business, but replying to emails is the second largest chunk of time.&quot;&gt;
Writing code is a big part of the business, but replying to emails is the second largest chunk of time. In the beginning I did that myself, but then I hired a company to provide the first level of support. That's been nice since I don't have to spend as much time on emails. Apt Folk is the name of the company and they offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://aptfolk.com/&quot;&gt;customer service management for developers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a big release for iPhoto Library manager. Then I think I'll definitely take a look at developing an app for the iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you share with other entrepreneurs, startups, and developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're doing software, there aren't a whole lot of upfront costs if you're a developer, so you don't necessarily have to raise tons and tons of money. You can usually start as one person, write an application and get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first start out, you'll probably be doing everything yourself, so start looking for opportunities to delegate stuff out, especially after you've gotten your product out there and have some income coming in. That way you're not running around doing absolutely everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ship early and ship often. By that, I mean, don't try to make everything perfect on the first launch, or try to stuff your app with features. Whittle it down to core features and get that out there. Make it good, but not perfect. Once you start getting feedback from people, then just iterate, iterate, iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;LaunchSpot is a tech incubator in Tempe, AZ. Although they got rolling about a year ago, they've spent a lot of time and money developing their space, located at Broadway and 52nd Street in Tempe, Arizona. In fact, here's a video tour of the coworking space before it was built out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/FjUTyUsubk4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What is the LaunchSpot Rapid Pitch Event?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tempe.gov/business/scitechfest/&quot;&gt;Tempe Geeks Night Out&lt;/a&gt;, LaunchSpot will be offering 6 early stage startups the opportunity to pitch entrepreneurs and investors on their idea. They will be given four minutes to pitch and six minutes for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They'll compete to receive a chance to get venture funding and other prizes including free office space at LaunchSpot, legal consultation with lawyers from Wong, Fuji &amp;amp; Carter, PC on business law, legal consultation with Wright Law Group, PLLC on intellectual property law, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So, how do I apply?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to do just two things to be considered for the LaunchSpot incubator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a two-minute video about your idea. No getting out of it, this is required&amp;hellip; make sure you address what your idea is, how it helps people, who it helps and why you're so passionate about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the online application form by the February 3rd deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You need to do the video first, because once you've made your video, you must upload it to YouTube and include a link to the video in your online application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaunchSpot will feature video submissions on their site and allow users to vote on the ones they like most. The video with the most likes will be offered an automatic place in the Rapid Pitch event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're ready, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rapidpitch.launchspot.com/entry-form/&quot;&gt;apply for the LaunchSpot Rapid Pitch Event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wait, who are the judges?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rapidpitch.launchspot.com/judges/&quot;&gt;judges&lt;/a&gt; are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr, Matt Kim, Founder and President QuanTera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steven G Mihaylo, CEO Crexendo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey Pruitt, Partner &amp;amp; CEO Tallwave&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting casually across from me, he could be anyone, anywhere. Just looking at him, or even speaking with him, you'd never know that this is a man who went from using his media center as a server for his startup to raising $1.5 million for that very same tech startup&amp;hellip; and in Arizona!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Paul takes a relaxed attitude, he's not afraid to speak his mind and stand by his beliefs. In this article, he shares his intimate thoughts on entrepreneurship, startups, funding and, most of all, what worked and what didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What startups have you been involved with in the past?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first startup was Cork Office. It was suppose to be an online office. Ironically, it was a lot like Facebook; right product, wrong market. So I came close&amp;hellip; but it's not quite the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next one was an IT service. We were able to remotely analyze what kind of software you were running and tell when you needed an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;I realized the industry is more about connections.&quot;&gt;
After that one, I got tired of doing B2B projects, just going in and competing against companies like Microsoft, and I realized the industry is more about connections. At that time I was only 23, and someone who's 23 doesn't have a lot of connections. So at some point I realized this project was DNR and just let it go.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a learning experience, and after that I said no more B2B. That's when I did something called One-a-Month, which I think every developer should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more about One-a-Month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically developed a project each month. And the rules were simple, one weekend, and it couldn't interfere with anything social. So if a friend called me and said, let's go to coffee, I'd go. I had to start it on Friday night and finish it by Sunday night. And finish it meant push it out to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I did really quick projects, but they started getting more elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was fun, but it was a learning experience. That's when I was learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.djangoproject.com/&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;. And a couple months into it, that's when I created this last start up that I just came out of. I put it up and it was a terrible website; just download this plugin and run it on WordPress. But then the Denver Post started using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged in one day and the server was down. The server was a machine inside my house that was also my media center. So while I'm watching Netflix, it's serving this startup. That's called bootstrapping, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do what you have to do, right? Because it worked. So when my server went down, I moved everything to Amazon EC2. Of all the One-a-Months I was doing, this is the one that got traction. And I thought, why not go with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started pursuing it. Raised a lot of money, put together a team, and made all the mistakes that a funded startup can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your experience raising money for a tech startup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a year, just working on raising money. Going to investor pitches, writing business plans, putting together one pagers, rehearsing my elevator pitch, walking into every writing workshop on how to write a pitch and pitch investors. I was raising money in Arizona, this wasn't Silicon Valley&amp;hellip; so it's not like I could walk over to a different investor event ever week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of investor events in Arizona, but they're more like get togethers for people who have money to invest. So if you just find one or two, people will invite you to the rest. You may go to some events that aren't investor events, but when you look around at all the people, you think, this is just like an investor event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for that is Phoenix was historically a real estate town. So the predominant story among investors is: &lt;em&gt;&quot;I made a lot of money in real estate, I can't make money in real estate now, my friend told me I can make money in startups.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; And that's pretty much the way it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what would you say was the key factor for you to raise money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of it is luck, and a lot of persistence. I applied at ASU, through something called Angelsoft, now called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gust.com/&quot;&gt;Gust&lt;/a&gt;. I submitted my information and someone found it. Then I got a call from someone at ASU saying, &lt;em&gt;&quot;We'd like to set up an interview.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;When you meet your first investor, it's a lot like dating.&quot;&gt;
We met for lunch. We had Greek or Italian or something. When you meet your first investor, it's a lot like dating. You go out, you see if you like them. You have to be nice, they're trying to be nice, then you go through a period where you're both not so nice, then you realize what their true colors are.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you date your first investor for a while, then he decides to introduce you to his friends. It's just like a girlfriend, you date her and then she decides that you're good enough to meet her friends. So you end up meeting his or her friends, and at some point you don't actually do the money raising. It's the first investor that you bring in that sees the potential, then they reach out to their friends and convince them. That surprised me cause I always thought you were looking for lots of investors, and what you're really looking for is an investor rep. I've talked with a lot of other entrepreneurs, and they've corroborated that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;The moment you decide to raise money, you know what you need to do, you just don't know what's going to happen.&quot;&gt;
After a while it's autopilot. The moment you decide to raise money, you know what you need to do, you just don't know what's going to happen. So you just keep going through the motions, and at some point you get that one investor that starts introducing you to other investors. Then you wake up one day and you get a phone call from your investor/girlfriend who says, &lt;em&gt;&quot;ok, I'm going to write the first check, he's going to write the second check&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, and you set up the office and start hiring a team.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the negotiation process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's painful&amp;hellip; I don't know if I can talk about the specific details about our contract, but it comes down to getting a good lawyer. Get a good lawyer if it's your first funding. 'Cause if it's your first time taking funding, chances are the investor is going to recommend a lawyer and chances are they're going to be friends with that lawyer, so you need to be careful about what you sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's unavoidable you're going to need a lawyer. Because just as you're afraid, the investor and his friends are just as wary. It's not that they don't trust you, they just don't want any loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to do convertible debt notes, that's the big thing right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, having said all that, I would say, don't raise money. The reason I say don't raise money is, we had a startup that went for three years with funding. And we started running out of money, so we had a decision: do we raise more money or pivot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, what surprised me is that we made more progress in the last 2 two months then we did in the previous three years. So that set off red flags in my head. I said, &lt;em&gt;&quot;if we can do as much with two employees in a few months what I did in three years with eight employees, why would I raise money?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-right&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;Having a lot of money gives you permission to mess up. Not having money, and having to bootstrap it forces you to think really, really hard.&quot;&gt;
That's stuck with me. It's about having the right team and making the right choices. Having a lot of money gives you permission to mess up. Not having money, and having to bootstrap it forces you to think really, really hard.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I feel fortunate that I had a multi-million dollar education about how &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to do a startup. So it's kind of a catch-22. If its your first start up, raise money, but go into it knowing that you're going to make a lot of mistakes, and make sure you take notes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were raising the money it was euphoria, and it's exciting. And if you have the ability to consistently turnaround startups, then yeah, raise money. But don't raise money thinking the money's going to solve your problems. Raise money because you know exactly how you're gong to apply it and exactly what you're going to use it. And the answer isn't: development&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take marketing&amp;hellip; even the word marketing is too general. Instead, say, here's our travel budget, these are the seven companies were going to meet with, here's how much we're going to spend on dinners. It's gotta be ironclad. The reason you do that is because if something doesn't work, you stop doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, crazy ideas work. Look at Groupon. They spent a ridiculous amount of money throwing parties and throwing crazy ad campaigns. I still contend they haven't really made money because they've made less than they spent, but by their standards, they're a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there will always be the argument that if you raise enough money, you can pay your way to success. But that's not how businesses really work. Those are outliers. You can say, this company succeeded doing this&amp;hellip; well, yes, but the number of companies that didn't succeed doing that is much greater, and chances are, you're going to fall into that last group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on bootstrapping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote-left&quot; data-pullquote=&quot;To me, bootstrapping is about finding a business model that you can execute, within your means. Period.&quot;&gt;
A lot of people think bootstrapping is about not raising money. To me, bootstrapping is about finding a business model that you can execute, within your means. Period.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means is, well, for developers, it's like, I can code that. But just because you can code it doesn't mean you can sell it. It doesn't mean you know the right people. I could probably develop software for the Boeing 747. But I'm not going to knock on Boeing's door and some guy's going to buy it from me. So I could spend a lot of energy on it, but odds are, I'm not going to be able to sell it. But some guy who used to work for Boeing, who's their ex-chief engineer, could probably sell it in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So find something that fits your ability to create it, sell it, maintain it, promote it. That's where funding can come in. Sometimes blind luck works, but you have to find the right team and make sure your product is the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bootstrap, the most important part is, you have to make some money on it. So make sure you have a viable product, and it's selling. Then, raise money to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice do you have for other entrepreneurs and startups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch your product to your customers, not your friends. Friends are great, but you should be more interested in marketing to actual customers than getting feedback about how cool your project is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And make a profit from your first customer. A lot of people think, we're going to make money eventually. If you spend a dollar, and you make two, your odds are much better than if its the other way around. Make it a clear, simple monetization model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at apps, they do one thing. And they'll charge you 99 cents to get it. Mobile devices are just connections to the Internet and apps are just a clean way of selling little snippets of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think websites are going to go down that route too. They're going to learn something from the mobile space. Instead of building a website that does a million things under the sun, build a website that does one thing and charge people 99 cents for it. There are so many websites, that you really can't count on people repeatedly coming back to your website in order for you to make money from advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you're picking a model, pick something that you can charge for right away and set the expectation that you're going to charge for it. The great thing about that is, you're going to be able to tell right away if people are interested in your product. If someone's not willing to pay $10, charge $5. If not $5, charge $1. If you can't sell it for 10 cents, stop selling it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, my wife and I were looking at midwifery services here in Phoenix. Now, you may be thinking, &quot;what does that have to do with &lt;a href=&quot;/services/search-engine-marketing&quot;&gt;search engine marketing&lt;/a&gt;?&quot; A lot actually, and let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midwife we liked doesn't rank for the keyword &quot;Phoenix Midwife.&quot; Which is a shame because it gets a decent number of searches each month and it's what she is. When I saw this, I wondered how I could get her to rank for that phrase. Let's take a look at the search results and then I'll share a few of my ideas with you. Just keep in mind that ultimately, this is how you should be thinking about your own search results for your small business or startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a quick look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?as_q=phoenix&amp;amp;as_q=midwife&quot;&gt;Google search results for Phoenix midwife&lt;/a&gt;. Think about the strategy you'd use to rank for this keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't have to scroll far to see this search has &quot;local intent&quot;. Local intent means that Google shows you results for midwives in the area. That's one opportunity to rank for this keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a look a little further down in the results, into page 2, you'll see some other interesting things like a couple videos, a Yelp page, an Angie's list listing, a city search listing and an Amazon book Listmania list. An additional 5 opportunities to rank for this keyword and it probably wouldn't take much to pop those onto the first page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I were trying to get my midwife to rank for these terms, here's the approach I'd take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd have her list herself in Yelp, Angie's list, and City Search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd work on a few other citations to help her rank for Google's local search results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd have her create some content on Amazon around midwives and home-birthing, maybe a book list or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I'd definitely be pulling out my Flip at our next appointment to shoot a video about Phoenix midwives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, I'd work on promoting a few of those pages, especially getting some ratings/reviews from past clients on the local listings. And if 7 opportunities to rank for a keyword aren't enough, I'd also have her run some Google ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to take this approach, be sure to brand each of the pages created on other sites with the same exact name and logo, to provide consistent branding across multiple sites. The reason for this is simple&amp;hellip; each time a potential client sees you in another search ranking, it's going to heighten his or her opinion of you. In a sense, it's pre-selling you based on sheer number of mentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in theory this sounds simple, but it's definitely easier said that done. If you need some help with your local SEO campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;please drop us a line&lt;/a&gt;, we'd be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <summary>Google says 90% of search is local, but many local businesses have no idea what they're doing. Which leaves things wide open for you if you just follow the strategy I lay out in this article. Kudos to my midwife for the inspiration!</summary>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we started Flatterline in 2009, we knew that we wouldn't need a permanent office space for a while. We worked out of our homes, various coffee shops, grabbed an extra desk at businesses and dropped-in at free coworking spaces. Those were fine for a while, but eventually we craved being around other professional, creative people with which to interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first day I dropped-in to work at CO+HOOTS &lt;a href=&quot;http://cohoots.com/&quot;&gt;creative coworking in Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, I was impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the companies at the space, and that kept me coming back almost every week since they opened. I was there so much I earned a special drop-in badge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, there were a broad range of companies including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonyfelicepr.com/&quot;&gt;public relations company&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://eekostudio.com/&quot;&gt;eco-friendly design company&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artifex10.com/&quot;&gt;landscape architecture design firm&lt;/a&gt; and several others. The rigorous application process for permanent desks seems to help gather companies that are dedicated to creating sustainable businesses and contributing to a growing community in the downtown Phoenix area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention they were recently selected by Phoenix Magazine's &lt;em&gt;&quot;Best of the Valley 2011&quot;&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoenixmag.com/best-of-the-valley/lifestyle-and-entertainment/&quot;&gt;Best Shared Work Space in Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;? If you haven't checked it out you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, you can try it for free! Flatterline has 5 passes good for 3 free drop-in days and we're giving them to the first 5 people to request them. Simply email us, tweet us or find us around town and they're yours (one per person, while supplies last, of course :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make 2012 your year to get out of the house and be productive!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's face it, many people have great ideas&amp;hellip; but how many people have the funds required to turn that idea into reality? For those startups and entrepreneurs looking for a little assistance to get going, AZ Disruptors might be just the opportunity you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a product, prototype, or idea for licensed software, a web-based application or a smart phone app, AZ Disruptors would like to help you develop it.

&lt;h3&gt;The Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to funding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogic.com/&quot;&gt;Blogic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memberdesk.com/&quot;&gt;Member Desk&lt;/a&gt; last year, AZ Disruptors is looking to fund up to 5 more startups this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply, be prepared to move to Phoenix (if you're not already here) to complete the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;You Give:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four months of your life&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Internet access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Association with smart people, including other startups who've been where you are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The Deadline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 13, 2012 is the next deadline to apply for the program&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Application Tips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide wireframes and/or mockups if you have them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a prototype that shows the main functionality of your idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have at least 1 co-founder &amp;mdash; 2-3 person teams are ideal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Are You Ready to Get Disruptive?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think Phoenix is fortunate to have a group like the AZ Disruptors working to fund startup ideas. If you're ready, apply for their January 13, 2012 deadline by filling out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azdisruptors.com/disruptive-company/&quot;&gt;AZ Disruptor incubator application&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an entrepreneur and leader, people look to you for the development of your company, it's vision and plan for moving forward. Of course, goal setting is a popular topic this time of year, so I thought I'd share a few approaches to goal setting, including a method for &lt;strong&gt;goal setting with agile&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many approaches to goal setting, it's important to consider the best approach for you and your business. If you fail to reach your goals, it may be due to which approach you choose.  Here are just a few goal setting methods to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Zig Ziglar Goal Setting Formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ziglar.com/&quot;&gt;Zig Ziglar&lt;/a&gt; is a known authority on personal motivation, management and sales training, and of course, goal setting. Here's his formula for goal setting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State your goal and the benefits for achieving it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a deadline for achieving it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify resources that can assist you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the skills you need to achieve the goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Zig Ziglar Goal Setting Videos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are great videos to watch if you have some time. Each video is about 4-5 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Ae-VJ_lauCw&quot;&gt;Goal Setting Video: Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/kiQV0oTyd98&quot;&gt;Goal Setting Video: Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/su2UuP3aqZg&quot;&gt;Goal Setting Video: Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;One Minute Manager Approach to Goal Setting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the One Minute Manager approach to goal setting is to establish clearly defined goals and expectations between a leader of an organization and the members of that organization. As a manager, establishing the objectives of your employees assures accountability in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and agree upon your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define what positive behavior looks like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and re-read your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to read your goals each day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if your behavior is in alignment with your goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The Agile Approach to Goal Setting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use an &lt;a href=&quot;/agile-development&quot;&gt;agile software development process&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also be applied to business and personal matters. To use an agile method for goal setting, you might take this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all your goals. Yes, ALL of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate the effort for each goal. Use the fibonacci sequence for rating: 1,2,3,5,8,13. If a goal has an effort higher than 8, break it down into smaller goals that require less effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize each goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check in with your goals daily and work on the priorities first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reassess and re-prioritize whenever you add new goals, gain new information or as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This agile method is a great way for prioritizing multiple goals and assuring that you're working on the goals that have the highest value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all three goal setting methods have a couple things in common; clearly establishing your goals, and constantly evaluating whether or not your actions are contributing to their achievement. That way you know you're on track to success this New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Traditional requirements gathering can take an enormous amount of time, keeping developers occupied for long periods documenting the requirements instead of writing code. Sometimes this produces hundreds of written pages of documentation that can become obsolete once the first line of code is written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Flatterline, we believe that working software is more important that a mountain of documentation. We understand that requirements change and we're flexible enough to handle those changes, whenever they may come. We're big proponents of the &lt;em&gt;Agile Methodology&lt;/em&gt; and one of the principles of agile software development states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Story Workshop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to not spend time and money unnecessarily on a heavy requirements gathering process, we use a technique called a &lt;em&gt;Story Workshop&lt;/em&gt;. It is a technique for eliciting &lt;strong&gt;roles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;functionality&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt; of the system from key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try to limit the initial story workshop to no more than two hours and we gather every idea for functionality in the system, even if we know that it's not something we'll be doing any time soon. At this point, the stories are at a pretty high level; more details of the story will come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anatomy of a Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story is kept simple and follows a pretty standard formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;As a ROLE IN THE SYSTEM
I should be able to ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING
So that I GET SOME VALUE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Roles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roles are all of the different types of actors in the system. These could be users, managers, administrators, system administrators or even the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Functionality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this is what the system allows an actor to do. Examples of functionality might include authenticating, sending an email, inviting another user, uploading files or creating data in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get really interesting. By attempting to record the value that a certain piece of functionality brings to the system, we begin to understand the motivation of our clients and their intended users. What problems are they solving and how does it fit in with the rest of the functionality? This key piece of information is extremely useful when it comes to prioritizing the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Estimating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about two hours we usually have a long list of desired functionality, a list of roles in the system and a better understanding of the problem this product will be attempting to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take these stories, estimate the effort we believe it would take to implement the functionality and arrive at an estimated time and cost for the product. We use the term &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; continuously here because we know that the requirements will inevitably change, and as the requirements change so do the time and cost of completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that the story workshop process can often be a cathartic experience for our clients. Not only have they captured all of their ideas regarding the functionality and roles in the system, but they have also had to think critically about why those things are important, or if they even are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a challenging two hours for our development team and our clients, but in the end, it is an essential part of how we build great software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looks like it's almost time for &lt;a href=&quot;http://desertcodecamp.com/&quot;&gt;Desert Code Camp&lt;/a&gt; again! What is this event, you ask? From their site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code Camps have been taking place all over the country.  This is a free, one-day event put on by the local Phoenix community to help promote software development in general.  There is no right or wrong language, platform, or technology.  If a topic relates in any way to the code that causes a machine to produce a desired result, it's welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year it will be held at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devry.edu/locations/campuses/loc_phoenixcampus.jsp&quot;&gt;DeVry University Phoenix Campus&lt;/a&gt; and is once again being organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekswithblogs.net/lorint/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Lorin Thwaits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatterline will be teaching two sessions this year in the 21st Century Software Development track: &lt;a href=&quot;http://desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=495&quot;&gt;Developing with CouchDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=477&quot;&gt;Understanding functional programming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schedule became available today, so if you haven't registered do so now and build your schedule for Saturday. It looks like there are a lot of great sessions this year and we can't wait to learn from all of our colleagues. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had a great turnout for the first &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/04/24/phoenix-opencoffee-club/&quot;&gt;Phoenix OpenCoffee Club&lt;/a&gt;, which took place April 30th at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azfairtrade.com/cafe/&quot;&gt;Fair Trade Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. About a dozen people, both entrepreneurs and investors, attended and spent several hours getting to know each other over some great coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard at least 6 ideas pitched and discussed during the 2 hours we were there. The assembled group wasn't shy about asking questions and raising concerns of the entrepreneurs pitching their ideas either. I know everyone appreciated hearing the perspectives of entrepreneurs and investors alike. We hope everyone who attended found the meetup engaging and useful. We sure did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Fair Trade Cafe for allowing us to host our event there. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2561649/&quot;&gt;May 7th Phoenix OpenCoffee Club&lt;/a&gt; will be held at Hob Nobs Coffee House. We'll try to have OpenCoffee Club every Thursday, so it's not a big deal if there are times you can't make it. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Flatterline believes heavily in the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing&quot;&gt;cloud computing&lt;/a&gt;. Dynamically allocated hardware on a pay-for-what-you-need basis has tremendous advantages when it comes to helping clients manage and provision their clusters. The main advantage of cloud computing is dynamically growing, or shrinking, hardware as the needs of the application change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the dynamic nature of cloud computing, we don't need a guaranteed answer on hardware requirements up front. However, a client may want a ballpark figure in order to set aside the right amount of budget or let investors know the estimated operational cost. You could crunch the numbers yourself, but why would you do that when we've already automated the process for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Determining optimal cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've constructed a very basic model for minimizing the cost of &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/a&gt; hardware resources which satisfies a minimum number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/&quot;&gt;EC2 Compute Units&lt;/a&gt; and a given amount of RAM per process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming&quot;&gt;linear programming&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Linear_Programming_Kit&quot;&gt;GNU linear programming kit (GLPK)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm a math geek that likes linear modeling, so if you're unfamiliar with either, I'd be happy to chat with you about them over lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, install the GLPK. On Ubuntu execute the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo aptitude install glpk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on Mac OS X execute the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo port install glpk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, download the following gist as &lt;code&gt;cloud_cost.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/101809.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Computing the cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model requires the specification of two variables: total number of EC2 Compute Units and RAM. Both variables are specified at the bottom with &lt;code&gt;param unitsNeeded&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;param ramRequiredPerAppInstance&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Change these params to reflect your particular situation. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: A future article will explore capacity planning in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're ready, execute the solver using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;glpsol --model cloud_cost.txt --output result.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing the results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program generates the result into a file called &lt;code&gt;result.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Assuming 500 EC2 Compute Units with 125MB of RAM per process, the file will look something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Problem:  cloud_cost
Rows:    7
Columns:  5 (5 integer, 0 binary)
Non-zeros: 15
Status:   INTEGER OPTIMAL
Objective: cost = 14400 (MINimum)

 1 InstanceQuantity[Small]
                    *              0             0
 2 InstanceQuantity[Large]
                    *              0             0
 3 InstanceQuantity[XLarge]
                    *              0             0
 4 InstanceQuantity[HCPULarge]
                    *              0             0
 5 InstanceQuantity[HCPUXLarge]
                    *             25             0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective function was cost, so the optimal arrangement of hardware needed to get that computational power costs $14,400/month. The second column of the hardware arrangement indicates the number of instance needed. In this case we need 25 high-CPU, extra large instances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Flatterline, our stated mission is to help startups realize their vision. To that end, we've decided to help bring &lt;a href=&quot;http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/15697/&quot;&gt;OpenCoffee Club to Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is OpenCoffee Club?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenCoffee Club is a weekly gathering of entrepreneurs and investors in an informal setting (a.k.a, a coffee shop). The goal is to bring these entrepreneurs and investors together to talk about projects, collaborate and get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was originally started in London by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indexventures.com/team#profile_id_10&quot;&gt;Saul Klein, a venture partner at Index Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, over 80 OpenCoffee Clubs have sprung up worldwide. You can read more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html&quot;&gt;Saul's blog&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_open_coffee_club_movement.php&quot;&gt;ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to Boulder, CO I attended an OpenCoffee Club facilitated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askthevc.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Jason Mendelson&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundrygroup.com/&quot;&gt;Foundry Group&lt;/a&gt;. It was really inspiring to see such a vibrant startup community meeting regularly to discuss ideas, share problems, give advice and, most of all, listen to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that Phoenix has a lot of talented, entrepreneurial people. We want them to have the best chance to grow and succeed and this is one small way we see that happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first meetup will be on Thursday, April 30 from 8am - 10am at Fair Trade Coffee. &lt;a href=&quot;http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2473241/&quot;&gt;Please let us know you're coming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In what other ways can we help the Phoenix startup community thrive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are a highly mobile laptop user, chances are you work out of a lot of varying public locations such as coffee shops, libraries, and just about anywhere that has public wifi. Are you concerned about the privacy of your data?If you're like me, and our clients, you're very concerned. Applications like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/tcpflow/&quot;&gt;tcpflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wireshark.org/&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; are not only particularly effective at grabbing content from the network, they also happen to be readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's a very simple scheme to leverage the inexpensive power of Amazon's EC2 to create a disposable, secure proxy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need the following to make this recipe work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon AWS account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ubuntu-based Amazon AMI with keypair (we are using publicami-7cfd1a15 for this article)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An EC2 security group allowing a minimum of port 22 for SSH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To start, launch a small instance of your AMI of choice. Once again, we prefer Ubuntu so most of this article is going to be Ubuntu-centric. This instance will need to be setup with whatever key pair you plan on using as well as be placed in the security group that allows SSH access. If you need help with this the Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://console.aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS console&lt;/a&gt; is particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Putting the pieces together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the instance is made available ssh to your newly created instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -i identity_file -L 3128:localhost:3128 root@public_ec2_domain_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noteworthy addition to the previous line is &lt;code&gt;-L 3128:localhost:3128&lt;/code&gt;. This addition to the SSH command will open port 3128 locally and forward all traffic to the remote port 3128 across the open SSH connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the connection is open you will need to install a proxy, we prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squid-cache.org/&quot;&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;. Squid can be installed through the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;aptitude update
aptitude install squid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last remaining step is to configure your browser of choice to use proxy &lt;code&gt;localhost:3128&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result is &lt;strong&gt;all local HTTP traffic will be relayed across local port 3128 across the encrypted SSH tunnel to the 10 cents / hour remote server&lt;/strong&gt;. From there it will go out to the internet at large away from the prying eyes of nefarious coffee shop patrons. &lt;strong&gt;Keep the SSH connection open for as long as you need access to the proxy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cleaning up after yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your done at the coffee shop feel free to decommission the AMI instance and you're done. The machine will go away with all records of the proxy's cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you're looking for a solution to more than just your HTTP traffic you have options such as OpenVPN. Look for an article from us soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
