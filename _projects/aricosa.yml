  Flatterline developed an API around an existing application for one of Aricosa's clients.
  The API was then used by a variety of 3rd party applications, including mobile applications and embeddable web widgets.
  Additionally, we developed a Twilio telephony application that used the API to provide an interface via an 800 number.
