project_description:
  Flatterline helped Minutelgass progress beyond their initial prototype and design mockups
  by creating a custom Ruby on Rails application to allow people or organizations to track
  their time. We also developed a robust API to allow desktop widgets, mobile applications
  and other 3rd party application to access an account, so time could be tracked from anywhere.
