  Jenny Poon--a woman who admittedly likes to tell people hell no, makes little children cry and says the best part of being a busines owner is, "I'm the BOSS!" But she won't spit in your hair, she'll admit her faults, and she'll go out of her way to make your day.

**Tell us about yourself**

I grew up in Minnesota. I went to the University of Minnesota and applied for the college of liberal arts, assuming that's where design would be, but it wasn't. I wasn't able to transfer, so I found the next thing, which was advertising and journalism. It wasn't what I planned to do, but it's helped me a lot now.

I like writing and I like understanding the advertising industry. But I still wasn't able to do what I love, which is design. So I went to design school, but by my second year, teachers were asking me how to do things, and I asked myself, "Why am I paying $4000 a semester to teach a class?"

So I stopped that and got an internship to do design work. I don't recommend people dropping out of school, ever...but it was the best decision for me, because I learned more at my internship than I ever did at school.

**What did you do after that?**

I worked for quite a few different magazines. It was great seeing how businesses work. But I got to the point where I was happy with my design work, but I hated the companies I was working for. Day after day, my anger grew. I would make suggestions, and it wasn't anything they were excited about. So I left.

I went to the Arizona Republic. I was art director of their local magazine, [AZ Magazine](http://www.azcentral.com/style/azmag/azmagdex.html). It was great because I got to meet entrepreneurs and small business people while learning about Phoenix, which really got me excited. 

**How did you know you wanted to start your own business?**

I remember growing up thinking, "I'll never be in a job I really love, cause that just doesn't happen." Kids grow up thinking that. They say, "I'm going to be a doctor because everyone says I should be a doctor." And they think about how they're going to work for somebody else. I think you have to work for somebody, so you know how to run your own business. I <i>love</i> running my own business.

My parents own a busines. They've run their own business for a really long time...since I was born. I had to work in the restaurant and I had to go work in the restaurant every day after shcool. I remember thinking, "This is terrible. My parents are always at work and I always have to be there helping. I never want to run my own business."

Friends would ask, "Do you want to run a business when you get older?" and I'd say, "No! That's a 24/7 job for the rest of your life. When you take a vacation, it's not really a vacation cause you're getting docked pay for not working." So I was very much against it. But then you start working for other people, and you realize maybe you're crazy and selfish and there are things you want to do your way, and you don't like doing things that don't have an effect on people.

That's how I felt, so I decided to start my own business...

**Tell us about that.**

My company, [Ecco Studio](http://www.eekostudio.com/) grew out of one of those things I was passionate about: sustainability. I see the benefit in solar and being more sustainabe, so I thought, "How can I help them with their cause?" I started searching out sustainable companies and hearing their stories, and learning about what they do. The ones that won me over were the ones I ended up working with.

And that's what Ecco ended up being about--finding clients and things to do that I'm passionate about. Anything that needs design help. Good ideas need good help. Ecco Studio has made a name out of helping small businesses brand themselves. We do logos, print advertising, web design, online advertising. 


**You also run a coworking space, so tell me about that.**

At first, I was working from home and I was doing great. But as I was growing and hiring on people, I knew it just wasn't going to work from home. Meeting at coffee shops just wasn't going to work either. I talked to a few people and looked into sharing space, just for the sake of small business and not taking crazy risks. So we looked at a few spaces, ran the numbers and it seemed to work. If everyone pitched in, we could pay the rent, pay for a few supplies, and everyone could focus on their business and not worry about where they were working out of.

That turned into Co+Hoots, a coworking space in downtown Phoenix. 

We gave it a try and its been successful. It's kinda magical...but honestly, the concept isn't hard to sell, expecially for the people who understand coworking and are looking for it. 

When people see what we're doing, they see it's really different. We have balance between social focus and revenue. We're a little bit of both and we're proud of that. But our model depends on paid members and people valuing what they're getting. that's something I've learned over time from doing it.

**How do you market your business?**

I've been really fortunate to not have to do much marketing. From the time I launched Ecco Studios, I had clients waiting to work with me. So when I launched, I had a flurry of work. It was great, but in the back of my head, I was always nervous about where my next paycheck was coming from. Am i going to pay the bills in six months? I always have 6-8 months leeway on everything. 

I love being in this community of people that are passionate about everything they're doing. So I asked, "How do I continue that?" The answer was by working with clients who are passionate about what they do.

Folio awards for best design. [Aztec awards](http://aztecawards.com/) for large and small events.

What cool things can we do that maybe don't raise a lot of revenue, taht opens all tehse ideas out. Hopefully that leads to bigger products. Big agencies are impersonal. A lot of stuff that comes out of agencies has been done and done and done again. I'm really big on keeping our team and creativeity fresh. We have the time to focus on you and focus on developing ideas, cauase they're like us; passionate.

I have lots of collaborators. That's how Co+hoots works. You work together with other people that are really strong in other skill sets and focus on your own skill set.

**Give me an example of how that works.**

The inital branding process what we need, is building a good brief to work from. Understanding the company, researching their competitor. I've always been the art designer and creative director, I've never been the business side person. i can do it, but its not what I'm passionate about, so I don't really want to do it. So I hand that over to one of my collaborators and I'm good. 

We're all working together, side by side, in the same space. So there's not as much miscommunication as you might have with a distributed team.

**How did you fund your startup?**

I was fortunate, cause I knew that I wanted to do this before I left my job, so I had time to prepare and a good cushion. It was in the back of my mind; I was mentally prepared for it. It was really exciting, and the hardest work I've ever done. So I loved doing it. I had money set aside, about 6-8 months, and I already had a computer. 


This isn't a restaurant, so I still take vacations, I work from home when I want to. I"M THE BOSS! It's scary going off on your own, but I was lucky. 

**What's the biggest mistake you've made?**

Thinking I could do it all by myself. I learned quickly that it's okay to ask for help. People really like being asked to help other people. It gives them a level of respect and increases their reputation. 

Try to think of it as not everyone's your competitor, but everyone's someone who could possibly help you. Tell me how I can help you, and here's what I need help with.  It's not about competing, it's about producing a good quality product. If you create a quality product, there's no way to compete. I always ask myself, "How can I get really excited about this project that I'm working on?" And then it flows...

If we're not excited about doing something, I can always pass it off to someone else who's a better fit. 

Know your worth and know when to say no.  I read this book called hell no. If there's any red flag that goes up at any point, then don't just say no, say hell no. There are plenty of people who will take up the project, and if you take it on, then you know you'll be kicking yourself later. So its okay if we starve for a day or two until we get a good project...but that hasn't happened yet **knocks on wood**.

**What's the best marketing you've done?**

Connecting with [Local First Arizona](http://www.localfirstaz.com/) was huge! Because it's right along side what I believe in--working with people that are passionate about what they're doing, working with local businesses, helping improve connectins between small businesses.

The next best thing was doing good work and having good client relationships, because those always spin off to more work. When you're working with a client, you need to make sure you're on your best behavior. Its simple things like being polite, respectful, don't spit in anyone's hair...

**What do you do when a client isn't on their best behavior?**

It alway needs to be equal balance. The client has to hold up their end of the deal and if they're not, you have to stand your ground. That goes back to knowing your worth. If someone's stepping on you, you have to put your foot down and sometimes it's just not going to work out, because you're a different personality or there's different expectations. That's okay, that comes with every single business. We've had to fire a few clients.

**How do you set expectations?**

I'm a strong believer in being harsh in the beginning. I learned that from being a teacher. You have to be a bitch and set the ground rules right at the getgo. Then there's no surprises in the future. What I did when I was a teacher is be really stern, you know, make kids cry, lay down the law, then the rest of it is easy.

You just make it very clear from the beginning, here are all our expectations, all our deliverables, all our deadlines. This is what you're going to get from me, this is what I'm going to get from you, and then you over deliver, and they'll be happy.

I never say I'm going to do something if I don't know I'm going to. And I always throw in little bonuses. In a trusted relationship, I think of it as friendships and personal relationships quite honestly, it is business, and money is exchange, but in the beginning if we're clear about expectations and we build a good relationsihp, then hell, I'll help you because I know what you're doing is good.

If that means I think of a cool promotional item I think you should do, and I don't tell you about it and I just do it and give it to you, and it makes your day, then hell yeah! I think that's just being a good person. What would you do for your brother or sister? That's what you should be doing for your client. 

**Some people that don't get along with their siblings could take that the wrong way.**

Yes, please do not throw their stuff animals down the stairs and lock them in the basement.

**What advice would you offer someone starting their own business?**

It's okay to say no.

Always stay focused on what you're passionate about.

Don't give your boss the finger on your way out the door as you're going to do your startup.

You can be happy at your job! It is possible! You can do this and be happy at your job. It's going to be hard work and you better be driven to do it, but you CAN do it!

If you're honest with people, they'll understand it. Admiting that you have faults, people are willing to help you overcome them.

As time went along, I got email, and people asking to be able to do other things. Eventually, it was a combination of me getting enough of these emails and iPhoto expanding its capabilities.  At that time I was working for a Mac development company for a couple years. My then girlfriend, now wife, was up in grad school, and I had plenty of free time in the evenings; basically I had no life. I'd go to my job and program all day, then I'd come home and work on my own programming. I was just kinda plunking away on it as a side project.  {" Eventually I said, what the heck, I'll try charging $20 for it, and it just kinda took off. "} Lots of people needed it; lots of people liked it. Within about a year, I was making as much for that as I was from my current job. Once it got to that point, I decide to transition over and do that full time. And I've been doing it ever since.
{% endpullquote %}

**Where did you get the idea from?**

That's the irony of the whole thing; I'm not into photography at all. My wife is, but my own photo collection is not much, so she gathers test data for me to work on. Initially it was just a fun project to teach myself. But it's been a lot of fun and its turned into a useful, troubleshooting tool for people using iPhoto. Users keep me pretty aware of breaking iPhoto issues.

{% pullquote %}
Once I had Library Manager out there a common question was do you have something for iTunes library management. So {" I allowed user feedback to influence the development of my next product. "} I wanted to diversify a little bit, since there's always the possibility with one product that Apple could add everything I do into their next release. It's always a possibility, but it's been nine years and it hasn't happened yet. I think they don't want to add too much to iPhoto because it would compete with their professional photo software, Aperture.
{% endpullquote %}

**Did having one successful project under your belt help you with your next product launch?**

Yes, both in terms of programming the app and marketing it. I was able to reuse the concepts and code from the previous app, as well as the whole process of putting up a website and offering it for sale in an online store. Plus I learned from all my previous mistakes.

**How did you market your app?**

{% pullquote left %}
{" I haven't done a whole lot of marketing in the traditional sense. "} For people with corrupted iPhoto libraries, I get a fair portion of my traffic that comes directly from Apple's own discussion forums, where there are users helping each other. There are 2-3 regular users who will help a lot of people with iPhoto stuff, and for a lot of common iPhoto problems, they say, *"Go try iPhoto Library Manager."*
{% endpullquote %}

I also have quite a few reviews, including a [review for iPhoto Library Manager on MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/53474/2006/10/iphotolibrarymanager.html). Of course, it always helps when those reviews are positive, 4.5 mice or whatever rating scale they use.

Now, there's enough juice behind my product name that if you start to type iPhoto, Google will give you a suggestion for iPhoto Library Manager. It's a keyword that gets over 20,000 searches each month.

**How did you transition to a paid model?**

I was a little worried whether there would be backlash, so what I ended up doing was making sure everything you could do in the free version of the software you could still do for free in the updated version and it was just the new features you had to pay to access.

I go back and forth on the best way to do trial limitations for software, because you have to have something in there. PowerTunes is time-limited, so it's fully featured but after 30 days it locks down and you have to pay. Whereas with iPhoto Library Manager there's no time limit. It's just if you want to do X, Y or Z you have to pay. I'm not a huge fan of that model, but it seems to work pretty well.

**How do you sell your app?**

I started by selling everything through my own online store. For that I use Potion Store, an [open source Ruby on Rails web store](http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore). It's on GitHub, and I'm not Rails expert, but I was able to learn enough to make the change and updates I need.

**Why not sell through the Mac App Store?**

When I first started, the app store didn't exist. And of course, the Mac app store has guidelines for what apps in the store are allowed to do. I fall outside of those guidelines. So I've never tried to sell there.

But the curve for the number of users for my app has gone up over time. Apple's selling more and more computers with people using iPhoto. As their user base grows, my customer base grows too. I'm in a really good situation.

**How do you spend your day?**

{% pullquote %}
{" Writing code is a big part of the business, but replying to emails is the second largest chunk of time. "} In the beginning I did that myself, but then I hired a company to provide the first level of support. That's been nice since I don't have to spend as much time on emails. Apt Folk is the name of the company and they offer [customer service management for developers](http://aptfolk.com/).
{% endpullquote %}

I'm working on a big release for iPhoto Library manager. Then I think I'll definitely take a look at developing an app for the iPhone or iPad.

**What advice would you share with other entrepreneurs, startups, and developers?**

When you're doing software, there aren't a whole lot of upfront costs if you're a developer, so you don't necessarily have to raise tons and tons of money. You can usually start as one person, write an application and get it out there.

When you first start out, you'll probably be doing everything yourself, so start looking for opportunities to delegate stuff out, especially after you've gotten your product out there and have some income coming in. That way you're not running around doing absolutely everything yourself.

And ship early and ship often. By that, I mean, don't try to make everything perfect on the first launch, or try to stuff your app with features. Whittle it down to core features and get that out there. Make it good, but not perfect. Once you start getting feedback from people, then just iterate, iterate, iterate.
