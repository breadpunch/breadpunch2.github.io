As part of a talk on functional programming I gave at <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com">Desert Code Camp</a> on Saturday, I ran a performance comparison of various languages when calculating the 41st Fibonacci number. I briefly showed a graph of the results, but felt it was interesting enough to warrant a separate post.

I encourage you to run the tests yourself and compare your results with those presented below.

<strong>What other languages would you like to see compared?</strong>
