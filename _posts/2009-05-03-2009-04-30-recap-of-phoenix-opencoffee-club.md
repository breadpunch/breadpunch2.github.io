We had a great turnout for the first [Phoenix OpenCoffee Club](http://flatterline.com/index.php/2009/04/24/phoenix-opencoffee-club/), which took place April 30th at [Fair Trade Cafe](http://www.azfairtrade.com/cafe/). About a dozen people, both entrepreneurs and investors, attended and spent several hours getting to know each other over some great coffee.

We heard at least 6 ideas pitched and discussed during the 2 hours we were there. The assembled group wasn't shy about asking questions and raising concerns of the entrepreneurs pitching their ideas either. I know everyone appreciated hearing the perspectives of entrepreneurs and investors alike. We hope everyone who attended found the meetup engaging and useful. We sure did!

Special thanks to Fair Trade Cafe for allowing us to host our event there. The [May 7th Phoenix OpenCoffee Club](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2561649/) will be held at Hob Nobs Coffee House. We'll try to have OpenCoffee Club every Thursday, so it's not a big deal if there are times you can't make it. Hope to see you there!
