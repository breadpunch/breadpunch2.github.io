Let's face it, many people have great ideas...but how many people have the funds required to make that idea into a reality? For those startups and entrepreneurs looking for a little assistance to get going, AZ Disruptors might be just the opportunity you're looking for...

tl;dr? Here's a video presentation by AZ Disruptors, outlining their incubator program. It runs about 6.5 minutes and covers all the main points.

## Who Are the AZ Distruptors?
Essentially, they're an incubator located in Scottsdale, Arizona. They're looking to help innovative ideas come to fruition, to either be bought by investors or generate sustainable profits.

## Who They're Looking For 
If you have a product, prototype, or idea for licensed software, a web-based application, or a smart phone app, AZ Disruptors would like to help you develop it. 

Or, if you want to be employed by a startup, partner with a startup, invest in a startup, or participate as a mentor or advisor, they'd like to hear from you as well.

## What Do AZ Disruptors Do?
Funding two startups is just the beginning. In addition to funding [blogic](http://www.blogic.com/), and [member desk](http://www.memberdesk.com/), AZ Disruptors is looking to fund up to 5 more startups. Here's the details...

### What You Give...

* Four months of your life at the incubator workspace
* 10% interest in your company

### What You Get...
* Office space
* Furniture
* Internet 
* Access to mentors
* Association with smart people, including other startups who've been where you are
* $20,000 cash

### The Deadline...
January 13, 2012 is the next deadline. Although there may be additional rounds of funding, if you're ready to go, hop on this opportunity now, as the site gives no assurance of additional opportunities.

## Are You Ready to Get Disruptive?

Some people may be reluctant to give up a part of their idea or a part of their company. But for many, that may be well worth it to get their project rolling. Regardless, we think Phoenix is fortunate to have a group like the AZ Disruptors working to fund startup ideas. If you're ready, apply for their January 13, 2012 deadline by filling out the [AZ Disrubtor incubator application](http://www.azdisruptors.com/disruptive-company/).
