When we started Flatterline in 2009, we knew that we wouldn't need a permanent office space for a while. We worked out of our homes, various coffee shops, grabbed an extra desk at businesses and dropped-in at free coworking spaces. Those were fine for a while, but eventually we craved being around other professional, creative people with which to interact.

From the first day I dropped-in to work at CO+HOOTS [creative coworking in Phoenix](http://cohoots.com/), I was impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the companies at the space, and that kept me coming back almost every week since they opened. I was there so much I earned a special drop-in badge!

At the time, there were a broad range of companies including a [public relations company](http://tonyfelicepr.com/), an [eco-friendly design company](http://eekostudio.com/), a [landscape architecture design firm](http://www.artifex10.com/) and several others. The rigorous application process for permanent desks seems to help gather companies that are dedicated to creating sustainable businesses and contributing to a growing community in the downtown Phoenix area.

Did I mention they were recently selected by Phoenix Magazine's *"Best of the Valley 2011"* as [Best Shared Work Space in Phoenix](http://www.phoenixmag.com/best-of-the-valley/lifestyle-and-entertainment/)? If you haven't checked it out you should.

In fact, you can try it for free! Flatterline has 5 passes good for 3 free drop-in days and we're giving them to the first 5 people to request them. Simply email us, tweet us or find us around town and they're yours (one per person, while supplies last, of course :).

**Make 2012 your year to get out of the house and be productive!**
