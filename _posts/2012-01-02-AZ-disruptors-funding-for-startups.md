Let's face it, many people have great ideas&hellip; but how many people have the funds required to turn that idea into reality? For those startups and entrepreneurs looking for a little assistance to get going, AZ Disruptors might be just the opportunity you're looking for.

If you have a product, prototype, or idea for licensed software, a web-based application or a smart phone app, AZ Disruptors would like to help you develop it. Or, if you want to be employed by a startup, partner with a startup, invest in a startup, or participate as a mentor or advisor, they'd like to hear from you as well.

### The Details

In addition to funding [Blogic](http://www.blogic.com/), and [Member Desk](http://www.memberdesk.com/) last year, AZ Disruptors is looking to fund up to 5 more startups this year.

If you apply, be prepared to move to Phoenix (if you're not already here) to complete the program.

#### You Give:

* Four months of your life
* 10% of your company

#### You Get:

* Access to mentors
* $20,000 cash
* Office space and furniture
* Internet access
* Association with smart people, including other startups who've been where you are

### The Deadline

**January 13, 2012 is the next deadline to apply for the program**.

#### Application Tips

* Provide wireframes and/or mockups if you have them
* Create a prototype that shows the main functionality of your idea
* Have at least 1 co-founder &mdash; 2-3 person teams are ideal

### Are You Ready to Get Disruptive?

We think Phoenix is fortunate to have a group like the AZ Disruptors working to fund startup ideas. If you're ready, apply for their January 13, 2012 deadline by filling out the [AZ Disruptor incubator application](http://www.azdisruptors.com/disruptive-company/)!

If you want more information, here's a video presentation by AZ Disruptors, outlining their incubator program. It runs about 6Â½ minutes and covers all the main points.
