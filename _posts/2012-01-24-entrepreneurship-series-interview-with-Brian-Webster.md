Brian Webster's a one-man-show who's done everything right without maybe even intending to. What's his secret? He attributes his success to making a quality product and responding well to customer feedback. But in this interview, you'll
see what his real secrets are...

<span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote="I had no life. I'd go to my job and
program all day, then I'd come home and work on my own programming.">
__Flatterline__: Tell me about your startup.

__Brian__: I'm currently a one-man software company, <a
target="_blank" href="http://fatcatsoftware.com">Fat Cat Software</a>.
I do programming for Mac OS X. I have three applications that I sell:
<a target="_blank" href="">iPhoto Library Manager</a>, <a
target="_blank" href="">PowerTunes</a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="">PlistEdit Pro</a>.
</span>

__Flatterline__: How did you get started?

__Brian__: I wish I could say I had some grand plan like I'm going to
start my own business, but it really just kinda happened...

iPhoto Library Manager originally started out as a programming project
to teach myself Mac OS X programming. iPhoto had just come out when I
graduated from college, and I hadn't found a job yet, so I had a lot
of free time on my hands. So I wrote this little program that would
allow people to switch between libraries, because iPhoto library only
allows for one library. I did it as freeware and Apple updated a year
later and I did an update and still remained free.

As time went along, I got email, and people asking to be able to do
other things. Eventually, it was a combination of me getting enough of
these emails and iPhoto expanding its capabilities.  At that time I
was working for a Mac development company for a couple years. My then
girlfriend, now wife, was up in grad school, and I had plenty of free
time in the evenings; basically I had no life. I'd go to my job and
program all day, then I'd come home and work on my own programming. I
was just kinda plunking away on it as a side project.  Eventually I
said, what the heck, I'll try charging $20 for it, and it just kinda
took off. Lots of people needed it; lots of people liked it. Within
about a year, I was making as much for that as I was from my current
job. Once it got to that point, I decide to transition over and do
that full time. And I've been doing it ever since...

__Flatterline__: Where did you get the idea from?

<span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote="I allowed user feedback to
influence the development of my next product.">
__Brian__: That's the irony of the whole thing; I'm not into
photography at all. My wife is, but my own photo collection is not
much, so she gathers test data for me to work on. Initially it was
just a fun project to teach myself. But it's been a lot of fun and its
turned into a useful, troubleshooting tool for people using iPhoto.
Users keep me pretty aware of breaking iPhoto issues.
</span>

Once I had Library Manager out there a common question was do you have
something for iTunes library management. So I allowed user feedback to
influence the development of my next product. I wanted to diversify a
little bit, since there's always the possiblity with one product that
Apple could add everything I do into their next release. It's always a
possibility, but it's been nine years and it hasn't happened yet. I
think they don't want to add too much to iPhoto because it would
compete with their professional photo software, Aperature.

__Flatterline__: Did having one successful project under your belt
help you with your next product launch?

__Brian__: Yes, both in terms of programming the app and marketing it.
I was able to reuse the concepts and code from the previous app, as
well as the whole process of putting up a website and offering it for
sale in an online store. Plus I learned from all my previous mistakes.

<span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote="You don't necessarily have to
raise tons and tons of money.">
__Flatterline__: How did you market your app?

__Brian__: I haven't done a whole lot of marketing in the tradition
sense. For people with corrupted iPhoto libraries, I get a fair
portion of my traffic that comes directly from Apple's own discussion
forums, where there are users helping eachother. There are 2-3 regular
users who will help a lot of people with iPhoto stuff, and for a lot
of common iPhoto problems, they say, "Go try iPhoto Library Manager."
</span>

I also have quite a few reviews, including a <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.macworld.com/article/53474/2006/10/iphotolibrarymanager.html">review for iPhoto Library Manager on MacWorld</a>. Of course, it always helps
when those reviews are positive, 4.5 mice or whatever rating scale
they use.

__Flatterline__: It sounds like you crafted your own niche.

__Brian__: Yes. There's enough juice behind my product name that if
you start to type iPhoto, Google will give you a suggestion for iPhoto
Library Manager. It's a keyword that gets over 20,000 searches each
month.

__Flatterline__: How did you transition to a paid model?

__Brian__: I was a little worried whether there would be backlash, so
what I ended up doing was making sure everthing you could do in the
free version of the software you could still do for free in the
updated version and it was just the new features you had to pay to
access.

I go back and forth on the best way to do trial limitations for
software, because you have to have something in there. Powertunes is
time-limited, so it's fully featured but after 30 days it locks down
and you have to pay. Whereas with iPhoto Library Manager there's no
time limit. It's just if you want to do x, y or z you have to pay. I'm
not a huge fan of that model, but it seems to work pretty well.

__Flatterline__: How do you sell your app?

__Brian__: The Mac app store has guidelines for what apps that are in
the store are allowed to do and I fall outside of those guidelines. So
I sell everthing through my own online store. For that I use Potion
Store, an open source <a
href="http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore">Ruby on Rails web
store application</a>. It's on GitHub, and I'm not Rails expert, but I
was able to learn enough to make the change and updates I need.

__Flatterline__: How many customers do you have?

__Brian__: I have a total of over 90,000 customers and growing. The curve has
gone up over time. Apple's selling more and more computers with people
using iPhoto. As their user base grows, my customer base grows too.
I'm in a really good situation.

<span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote="Once you start getting feedback from
people, then just iterate, iterate, iterate.">

__Flatterline__: How do you spend your day?

__Brian__: Writing code is a big part of the business, but replying to emails is the second largest chunk of time. In the beginning I did that myself, but then I hired a company to provide the first level of support. That's been nice since I don't have to spend as much time on emails.  Apt Folk is the name of the company and they offer <a target="_blank" href=http://aptfolk.com/">customer service management for developers</a>.
</span>

__Flatterline__: What are your future plans?
I'm working on a big release for iPhoto Library manager. Then I think
I'll definitely take a look at developing an app for the iPhone or
iPad.

__Flatterline__: What are your thoughts on funding?

__Brian__: When you're doing software, there aren't a whole lot of
upfront costs if you're a developer, so you don't necessarily have to
raise tons and tons of money. You can usually start as one person,
write an application and get it out there.


__Flatterline__: What advice would you share with other entrepreneurs,
startups, and developers?

__Brian__: When you first start out, you'll probably be doing
everything yourself, so start looking for opportunites to delegate
stuff out, especially after you've gotten your product out there and
have some income coming in. That way you're not running around doing
absolutely everything yourself.

And ship early and ship often. By that, I mean, don't try to make
everything perfect on the first launch, or try to stuff your app with
features. Whittle it down to core features and get that out there.
Make it good, but not perfect. Once you start getting feedback from
people, then just iterate, iterate, iterate.
