Tomorrow marks the last day of the first full week of Flatterline operations, and let me say it's been awesome.

First and foremost, I would like to thank everyone that's wished us luck on this endeavor! All the support has really meant a lot to us. I would also like to thank everyone that has so innocently asked "Dude, why do you still have the default WordPress post up?" The essential answer is that everything came together so quickly for Curtis and I to put this company together that getting some content up became a secondary-but-still-really-high-priority item. Which I am now rectifying...

That being said, the weeks ahead are going to be busy. Amazingly wonderful and deliciously busy. Next Thursday Curtis and I, along with several other cohorts, will be trekking out to Texas for SXSW. We plan on spending some time to really get the name out there, so if you're going please help spread the word to your entrepreneur friends (more on why we're focusing on this segment to come!). We're also going to be looking to make this page a little more "custom". Sure, it's a nice theme but it would benefit from a logo (which we don't have) and some more style (which we have, but not in CSS form).

Personality Flatline has taken a temporary hiatus while we are getting everything in motion, but rest assured the content on my harddrive that was recorded mid-December is still both salient and awesome. If we do it right, all the references to "the holidays" will seamlessly sound like Easter.
