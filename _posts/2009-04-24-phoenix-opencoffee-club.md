At Flatterline, our stated mission is to help startups realize their vision. To that end, we've decided to help bring [OpenCoffee Club to Phoenix](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/15697/).

### What is OpenCoffee Club?

OpenCoffee Club is a weekly gathering of entrepreneurs and investors in an informal setting (a.k.a, a coffee shop). The goal is to bring these entrepreneurs and investors together to talk about projects, collaborate and get to know each other.

It was originally started in London by [Saul Klein, a venture partner at Index Ventures](http://www.indexventures.com/team#profile_id_10). Since then, over 80 OpenCoffee Clubs have sprung up worldwide. You can read more about it on [Saul's blog](http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html) or at [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_open_coffee_club_movement.php).

### Why?

On a recent trip to Boulder, CO I attended an OpenCoffee Club facilitated by [Jason Mendelson](http://www.askthevc.com/blog/) of the [Foundry Group](http://www.foundrygroup.com/). It was really inspiring to see such a vibrant startup community meeting regularly to discuss ideas, share problems, give advice and, most of all, listen to each other.

We believe that Phoenix has a lot of talented, entrepreneurial people. We want them to have the best chance to grow and succeed and this is one small way we see that happening.

The first meetup will be on Thursday, April 30 from 8am - 10am at Fair Trade Coffee. [Please let us know you're coming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2473241/).
