title: "Pitching as a Woman in a Room Full of Dudes"

Kristine Kassell, Susan Cordts and Courtney Klein spoke to a group of entrepreneurs at the 2012 ASU Startup Summit. The breakout session entitled, "Pitching as a Woman in a Room Full of Dudes" gave many the opportunity to ask these succesful entrepreneurs a few questions.

**As a woman, what challenges have you faced when being at the table with men?**

**Susan**: Confidence is important. It's hard to have that when you're young, but it's very, very important. Everyone respects confidence.

**Kristine**: I deal with clients everyday that are business owners, men and women. You have to adapt your sales strategy for that person. You have to find out what's important to them. Be yourself, be an expert in your industry, be confident about what you're delivering if you want people across the table to respect you.

I started my agency at 23 years old. I was trying to sell this older, successful business man long term care insurance.  He said, "My buddy's been trying to sell me that for years." So I said, "Okay, let's just focus on the group insurace." He responded by saying, "I'd rather buy it from you, cause you're gonna be around when I'm in that facility...my buddy's gonna be in there with me..."

So don't be afraid you're too young. It's easy to get respect if you know your product. And there are different advantages that we don't always recognize until someone points them out to us.

**Courtney**: It's all about the handshake. For me as a woman, walking into the room, there's this certain reaction, and you know the reaction...and you know in a nano second if the reaction is going to be someone that respects you and is going to listen to you, or if it's someone who thinks otherwise. And you know by how he looks at you, and how he shakes your hand.

So, as a woman, when you go in to shake a guys hand, you gotta be forecful...it's gotta be strong. You can tell by the way he shakes your hand, if he takes and turns your hand over, or if it's the light sqeeze, or you cut him off mid shake, it's no dice, right. So you have to meet a guy where he's at and pay atttention to how he shakes your hand back. It's an indication of how seriously he's going to take you.




**How do you balance your career and your personal life?**

**Susan**: It's a very important thing and very difficult to do. I hear a lot of people say there's no such thing as balance, and I think that may be true. You must make time and focus on the things that are important to you. If you don't set time aside for the things that are important to you, then they aren't. When you identify something that's important to you, then you can determine how much time you're going to spend on it.

**Kristine**: It depends on where you're at. When I started my business I was single. It's been harder for me to adapt with a family. Finding that perfect mate or support is a big factor. You have to spend time with them and that they support you and understand what you're going through.

**Courtney**: I had a perception early on, that it meant something to say I was busy all the time. So whenever I was asked, I said, "Oh my God, I'm slammed." And I really was busy, but I hated giving that answer. And it somehow validated that I was working really hard if I was cranking 100 hours, and then telling people I was cranking 100 hours. 

After a few years, I realized, this is not sustainable. And I don't admire people that all they do is work...and yet, I was one of them. So I had to become really disciplined about chunking out time to myself. If you see my calendar to this day, there's blocked time, and no one can touch that. It's my time to do whatever I need to do, whether that's catching up on work stuff, or going to the gym, or going for a bike ride, whatever it is, it's blocked.

And I've been very intentional about it, because that's how I had to manage my time, I had to carve it out.d And now when people ask me how I'm doing, I say, "Oh, I went for a bike ride this morning, and then I dove into work, and then I had lunch with a collegue." And I'm so much more balanced and I'm still producing at a really high level. But there's some perception that if I was having fun, that meant I wasn't working hard enough. It took a real mental shift to get over that. And now I'm so much more happier and so much more balanced.





**How did you recognize the turning point in your life and how did you make a change for yourself**

**Susan**:

**Kristine**:

**Courtney**: There have been a few turning points for me. One I had early into my career. I had a refigerator with ketchup packets, spoiled soy milk (which is really hard to do, by the way, because it has like a 6 month expiration), and some bread. That was all that was in my refrigerator. And I remember walking downstairs at 2am in the morning in search of food, and thinking, "What am I doing? I was raised to feed myself, yet this is all I have...?"

That was a real moment, and yet I pushed through that one.

Another time, I felt physically and emotionally exhausted. I hit a wall. And I thought, "Do I shut down my organization? Do I stop? Do I leave? What do I do?" So I took ten days to visit my sister in Montana and chilled out. It took six days to just chill out. And I thought, "This is not right. I should be chill every morning when I wake up, and before I go to bed at night." But this angst, this anxiety,  the stress I was holding on to just wasn't healthy. And it crops up every now and again, but now I recognize it.

As time went along, I got email, and people asking to be able to do other things. Eventually, it was a combination of me getting enough of these emails and iPhoto expanding its capabilities.  At that time I was working for a Mac development company for a couple years. My then girlfriend, now wife, was up in grad school, and I had plenty of free time in the evenings; basically I had no life. I'd go to my job and program all day, then I'd come home and work on my own programming. I was just kinda plunking away on it as a side project.  {" Eventually I said, what the heck, I'll try charging $20 for it, and it just kinda took off. "} Lots of people needed it; lots of people liked it. Within about a year, I was making as much for that as I was from my current job. Once it got to that point, I decide to transition over and do that full time. And I've been doing it ever since.
{% endpullquote %}

**Where did you get the idea from?**

That's the irony of the whole thing; I'm not into photography at all. My wife is, but my own photo collection is not much, so she gathers test data for me to work on. Initially it was just a fun project to teach myself. But it's been a lot of fun and its turned into a useful, troubleshooting tool for people using iPhoto. Users keep me pretty aware of breaking iPhoto issues.

{% pullquote %}
Once I had Library Manager out there a common question was do you have something for iTunes library management. So {" I allowed user feedback to influence the development of my next product. "} I wanted to diversify a little bit, since there's always the possibility with one product that Apple could add everything I do into their next release. It's always a possibility, but it's been nine years and it hasn't happened yet. I think they don't want to add too much to iPhoto because it would compete with their professional photo software, Aperture.
{% endpullquote %}

**Did having one successful project under your belt help you with your next product launch?**

Yes, both in terms of programming the app and marketing it. I was able to reuse the concepts and code from the previous app, as well as the whole process of putting up a website and offering it for sale in an online store. Plus I learned from all my previous mistakes.

**How did you market your app?**

{% pullquote left %}
{" I haven't done a whole lot of marketing in the traditional sense. "} For people with corrupted iPhoto libraries, I get a fair portion of my traffic that comes directly from Apple's own discussion forums, where there are users helping each other. There are 2-3 regular users who will help a lot of people with iPhoto stuff, and for a lot of common iPhoto problems, they say, *"Go try iPhoto Library Manager."*
{% endpullquote %}

I also have quite a few reviews, including a [review for iPhoto Library Manager on MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/53474/2006/10/iphotolibrarymanager.html). Of course, it always helps when those reviews are positive, 4.5 mice or whatever rating scale they use.

Now, there's enough juice behind my product name that if you start to type iPhoto, Google will give you a suggestion for iPhoto Library Manager. It's a keyword that gets over 20,000 searches each month.

**How did you transition to a paid model?**

I was a little worried whether there would be backlash, so what I ended up doing was making sure everything you could do in the free version of the software you could still do for free in the updated version and it was just the new features you had to pay to access.

I go back and forth on the best way to do trial limitations for software, because you have to have something in there. PowerTunes is time-limited, so it's fully featured but after 30 days it locks down and you have to pay. Whereas with iPhoto Library Manager there's no time limit. It's just if you want to do X, Y or Z you have to pay. I'm not a huge fan of that model, but it seems to work pretty well.

**How do you sell your app?**

I started by selling everything through my own online store. For that I use Potion Store, an [open source Ruby on Rails web store](http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore). It's on GitHub, and I'm not Rails expert, but I was able to learn enough to make the change and updates I need.

**Why not sell through the Mac App Store?**

When I first started, the app store didn't exist. And of course, the Mac app store has guidelines for what apps in the store are allowed to do. I fall outside of those guidelines. So I've never tried to sell there.

But the curve for the number of users for my app has gone up over time. Apple's selling more and more computers with people using iPhoto. As their user base grows, my customer base grows too. I'm in a really good situation.

**How do you spend your day?**

{% pullquote %}
{" Writing code is a big part of the business, but replying to emails is the second largest chunk of time. "} In the beginning I did that myself, but then I hired a company to provide the first level of support. That's been nice since I don't have to spend as much time on emails. Apt Folk is the name of the company and they offer [customer service management for developers](http://aptfolk.com/).
{% endpullquote %}

I'm working on a big release for iPhoto Library manager. Then I think I'll definitely take a look at developing an app for the iPhone or iPad.

**What advice would you share with other entrepreneurs, startups, and developers?**

When you're doing software, there aren't a whole lot of upfront costs if you're a developer, so you don't necessarily have to raise tons and tons of money. You can usually start as one person, write an application and get it out there.

When you first start out, you'll probably be doing everything yourself, so start looking for opportunities to delegate stuff out, especially after you've gotten your product out there and have some income coming in. That way you're not running around doing absolutely everything yourself.

And ship early and ship often. By that, I mean, don't try to make everything perfect on the first launch, or try to stuff your app with features. Whittle it down to core features and get that out there. Make it good, but not perfect. Once you start getting feedback from people, then just iterate, iterate, iterate.
