Kristine Kassell, Susan Cordts and Courtney Klein spoke to a group of entrepreneurs at the 2012 ASU Startup Summit. The breakout session entitled, "Pitching as a Woman in a Room Full of Dudes" gave many the opportunity to ask these succesful entrepreneurs a few questions regarding gender issues in business.

**As a woman, what challenges have you faced when being at the table with men?**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: Confidence is important. It's hard to have that when you're young, but it's very, very important. Everyone respects confidence.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: I deal with clients everyday that are business owners, men and women. You have to adapt your sales strategy for that person. You have to find out what's important to them. Be yourself, be an expert in your industry, be confident about what you're delivering if you want people across the table to respect you.

I started my agency at 23 years old. I was trying to sell this older, successful business man long term care insurance.  He said, "My buddy's been trying to sell me that for years." So I said, "Okay, let's just focus on the group insurace." He responded by saying, "I'd rather buy it from you, cause you're gonna be around when I'm in that facility...my buddy's gonna be in there with me..."

So don't be afraid you're too young. It's easy to get respect if you know your product. And there are different advantages that we don't always recognize until someone points them out to us.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: It's all about the handshake. For me as a woman, walking into the room, there's this certain reaction, and you know the reaction...and you know in a nano second if the reaction is going to be someone that respects you and is going to listen to you, or if it's someone who thinks otherwise. And you know by how he looks at you, and how he shakes your hand.

So, as a woman, when you go in to shake a guys hand, you gotta be forecful...it's gotta be strong. You can tell by the way he shakes your hand, if he takes and turns your hand over, or if it's the light sqeeze, or you cut him off mid shake, it's no dice, right. So you have to meet a guy where he's at and {"pay atttention to how he shakes your hand back. It's an indication of how seriously he's going to take you."}

**How do you balance your career and your personal life?**

{% pullquote %}
<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: It's a very important thing and very difficult to do. I hear a lot of people say there's no such thing as balance, and I think that may be true. You must make time and focus on the things that are important to you. {"If you don't set time aside for the things that are important to you, then they aren't important."} When you identify something that's important to you, then you can determine how much time you're going to spend on it.
{% endpullquote %}

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: It depends on where you're at. When I started my business I was single. It's been harder for me to adapt with a family. Finding that perfect mate or support is a big factor. You have to spend time with them and that they support you and understand what you're going through.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: I had a perception early on, that it meant something to say I was busy all the time. So whenever I was asked, I said, "Oh my God, I'm slammed." And I really was busy, but I hated giving that answer. And it somehow validated that I was working really hard if I was cranking 100 hours, and then telling people I was cranking 100 hours. 

After a few years, I realized, this is not sustainable. And I don't admire people that all they do is work...and yet, I was one of them. So I had to become really disciplined about chunking out time to myself. If you see my calendar to this day, there's blocked time, and no one can touch that. It's my time to do whatever I need to do, whether that's catching up on work stuff, or going to the gym, or going for a bike ride, whatever it is, it's blocked.

And I've been very intentional about it, because that's how I had to manage my time, I had to carve it out.d And now when people ask me how I'm doing, I say, "Oh, I went for a bike ride this morning, and then I dove into work, and then I had lunch with a collegue." And I'm so much more balanced and I'm still producing at a really high level. But there's some perception that if I was having fun, that meant I wasn't working hard enough. It took a real mental shift to get over that. And now I'm so much more happier and so much more balanced.

**How did you recognize the turning point in your life and how did you make a change for yourself**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: I have 22 year old kids. I made sure I was at every sporting event. That meant sometimes flying back from Germany to go to a game, to get on a plane back to Germany. I realized after doing that for two and a half years, what have I just missed? I got to see every game, but I missed the experience of getting there. And it just wasn't worth it...I was done.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: You can't be everywhere; you can't say yes to everything. Learning to say no is okay. It's really okay to say no. 

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: There have been a few turning points for me. One I had early into my career. I had a refigerator with ketchup packets, spoiled soy milk (which is really hard to do, by the way, because it has like a 6 month expiration), and some bread. That was all that was in my refrigerator. And I remember walking downstairs at 2am in the morning in search of food, and thinking, "What am I doing? I was raised to feed myself, yet this is all I have...?"

That was a real moment, and yet I pushed through that one.

Another time, I felt physically and emotionally exhausted. I hit a wall. And I thought, "Do I shut down my organization? Do I stop? Do I leave? What do I do?" So I took ten days to visit my sister in Montana and chilled out. It took six days to just chill out. And I thought, "This is not right. I should be chill every morning when I wake up, and before I go to bed at night." But this angst, this anxiety,  the stress I was holding on to just wasn't healthy. And it crops up every now and again, but now I recognize it now.

**Question: Being a motivated young woman, how should I balance that with a relationship. Does the person I'm with need to be as motivated about making a difference in the world as I am? How has that played out in your life?**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: My husband is my biggest cheerleader. He thinks everything I do is great. If only it was...I didn't always realized how important that was. You have to be objective about how relationships impact you, or slow you down by forcing you to be someone you're not.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: People are intimidated. Men might say I don't want someone who's as much as me. I don't think they have to run at my same pace, but they have to believe in what you're doing. You have to be compatible. That person will make you stronger. 

{% pullquote %}
<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: That's a fantastic question. {"I firmly believe you need to be with someone that meets your energy level and inspires you to be the best you you can possibly be."} Whatever that looks like is up to you to determine. Public perception says you need to find a counter balance, someone that runs at a slower pace. That's a very logical, head-based decision to make. What I've learned is, it needs to be a heart based decision. Who is it that meets you in a passionate field? Who is it that meets you in inspiration and conquering the world and makes you want to go out and fight for what you believe in? Being out solo in the world, and fighting on your own, is a very lonely feeling in a relationship. So I would avoid that at all costs.
{% endpullquote %}

**Question: I want to do everything and I hate saying no to anything. So how do you figure out how to balance it?**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: What is really important to me? If you always live your life for somene else, you're never going to be satisfied. I don't do the things that aren't important to me. I prioritize by what's important to me. There's a billion things that people want you to do. If you try to do everything, you realize you're not doing good for anybody. Don't try to do too much or make too many people happy.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: You can do everything at 10%, but that's not fair to the other parties. You can't go to everything. If you can look back at some of the things you didn't do and say, "It wasn't a big deal that I wasn't involved with that. That step one in realizing you don't have to be involved in everything.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: You can choose to be a mile long and an inch deep. Or an inch deep and a mile long. It's choice...neither's right or wrong. But I feel the depth defines your identity. Something I've thought a lot about is "What am I about?" I get calls all the time and asked to do things all the time. So define what you're about. So for me, it's in my DNA to help other young people do what I did. That fuels me...I get something out of that and I hope they do too. Over the past six months I've dropped off five boards, but it wasn't me. Sure it's prestigious and glamorous, but I had to ask, "Did that fuel me?" 

{% pullquote %}
I'm a very linear thinker, so I drew up a grid of all the things I was doing. I went back to my calendar and drew a list of events, meetings, and what my day like. Ask "what was it about me that those things were fulfilling?" You can score it on points or x-boxes. If it doesn't get enough points, then just drop it. Just make a list of all the things you have the option to do and just score it. And decide yes or no. I don't need a scoring sheet any more, but it helped me get to the place where I could say no. You don't need to give any other reason. No is a complete sentence.

At the end of the day, what would you live and die for? {"If you had one cause, or five causes to believe in, what would you be about? All the other ones need to go away because otherwise your identity gets lost."} I don't know who you are in your essence, so defining that helps you define what you focus your attention on.
{% endpullquote %}

**Question: Do you cater your speech to men?**

{% pullquote %}
<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: You have to always prepare yourself for whoever your audience is. {"You should not think that you have to do something dramatically diffferent when talking to a man versus a woman."} Expecially dressing some particular way. I think people get caught up rather than just genuinely being who they are. And be honest about that and people will respect you for that.
{% endpullquote %}

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: People like to talk about themselves. So I have a general rule of 30/70, sometimes 40/60. Whoever's called the meeting, you should be speaking 30% of the time, they should be speaking 70%. It's an engaging exercise. If you're speaking 90% of the time, you've given them no opportunity to provide feedback. I really heavily on feedback. 

So sometimes I start a dialogue with a leading question. For example, when I'm pitching Microneeds, I say something like: "So let me ask you, if you were to go out right now and find a need in the world, where woudl you go?" So it's always a leading question.


**Question: I find myself dressing down and toning the 'me' factor down. I always feel like I'm restricting myself. Did you ever struggle with that, and how did you get to the point of not caring about what other people think aobut you?**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: I was 20 when I started, and I'm in these meetings with major CEOs of companies. So I did have to dress the part...I had to dress differently than I would on weekends. It got so bad for me that I'd be out on the weekends with a girlfriend, and I still had to represent myself professionally, just in case I met someone. So you'd see me walking through the farmers market still dressed very professionally, in case I ran into someone. 

I think that was a good decision. I didn't feel inauthentic about that, but I was certainly mindful of it. I needed to establihs a certain credibility. I learned later that it wasn't about how I dress, it was about how I carry myself. I realized that I'm allowed to be me. And I do dress nicely...I dress classy regardless of where I'm at. So own that and be comfortable with that.



**Question: Was there ever a time when someone wasn't taking you seriously? How did you approach that situation, how did you handle it and were you able to turn it around?**

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/susan-cordts.jpg" title="Susan Cordts" alt="Susan Cordts" /> **Susan**: I've lived my career in more of a man's world than a woman's world. When I worked in robotics, when it came to predictive modeling, I don't think I met a woman in the first five years of working there. I used to get extremely frustrated because our chairman of the board, a wonderful man, knew nothing about predictive modelning. He would go to meetings with me, and everyone would think he was the CEO of the company and this is who they're having the meeting with. And I'd sit back and think, "Go ahead, ask him all the questions you'd like, cause he doesn't know anything." 

I let that go on for a while until the person would figure out they were talking to the wrong person. I'd let them step into that on their own. Usually, the chairman of the board would say, "You're going to have to ask Susan that, because I don't really know, and she's the CEO of the company."

You don't have to be in people's face. If you get too blunt or direct, you turn people off.

<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/kristine-kassell.jpg" title="Kristine Kassell" alt="Kristine Kassell" /> **Kristine**: I'm also in an industry that's predominantly male. I was an assistant for about five years. I worked with agents in the community. So after working for someone else for so many years, I knew I could do it better, and I broke off and did it on my own. When I first went out there, everyone refered to me as my former boss' girl. I've had my business for 15 years, and I still get people asking me if I'm still working for my old boss. And I know they're not engaged. So I just get out there and prove myself by earning business.

{% pullquote %}
<img align="left" style="width:50px;padding:10px;" src="/images/courtney-klein.jpg" title="Courtney Klein" alt="Courtney Klein" /> **Courtney**: My experience has been around fundraising. The thing I'd share is you have to know when to say no and when to turn down money. And I've turned down a lot of money, because it was tainted with an ulterior motivation, like I want to identify myself with you and latch on to you as this young, aspiring entrepreneur in town. And there's that moment when you get that email: "Hey, let's chat about the donation over drinks." And it's like, no thank you. And there will be no drinks, no lunch and no coffee. We're done. {"You have to know where that line is and call it. You leave the money on the table but your integrity intact."}
