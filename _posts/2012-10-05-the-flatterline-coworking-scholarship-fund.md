From the inception of our company, coworking has played a very
important role. We've worked from, held meetings at and learned
from other businesses at an amazing [coworking space in Phoenix](http://cohoots.com).
Now, we'd like to give other freelancers and small businesses
the opportunity, for free, to experience the benefits that
coworking can offer.

To that end, we've teamed up with CO+HOOTS to offer the chance
to win a **two month, unlimited coworking membership**!

One membership will be raffled every week for the next eight
weeks. There's no purchase necessary. All you need to do is show
up at any of the [free events hosted at CO+HOOTS](http://www.cohoots.com/events/)
or Washington Row and leave your contact information with a
CO+HOOTS representative.

For all the details, see the official
[Flatterline Coworking Scholarship Fund](http://www.cohoots.com/blog/flatterline-scholarship-fund/)
page on the CO+HOOTS website.

Best of luck!
