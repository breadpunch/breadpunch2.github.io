excerpt: Google says 90% of search is local, but many local businesses have no idea what they're doing. Which leaves things wide open for you if you just follow the strategy I lay out in this article. Kudos to my midwife for inspiring it...

title: What My Midwife Taught Me About SEO

---

My wife and I were looking at midwifery services here in Phoenix. Now, you may be thinking, "what does that have to do with [search engine marketing](/services/search-engine-marketing)?" Let me tell you...

First off, let me say, my wife has gotta be the most patient woman in the world, cause she listened to me rant about this for 30 minutes when we were suppose to be looking for a [Phoenix midwife]. Now, you don't have to have my wife's patience to get something out of this, cause what I'm about to share will just take 5 minutes of your time...

Now, the midwife we liked doesn't rank for the keyword "Phoienix Midwife." Which is a shame, cause it gets a decent number of searches each month and it's what she is. When I saw this, I thought, "I wonder how I could get her to rank." So let's take a look at the search results and I'll share a few of my ideas with you. Just keep in mind that ultimately, this is how you should be thinking about your own search results for your small business or startup.

Now, you don't have to scroll far to see this search has local intent. Local intent means that Google is showing us a bunch of midwives around the area I live in. That's one opportunity to rank for this keyword.

If you take a look a little further down in the results, like page 2, you'll see some other interesting things, like a couple videos, a Yelp page, an Angie's list listing, a city search listing, and an Amazon book Listmania list. That's 5 opportunites to rank for this keyword, in addition to your own website.

So, if I were going to try to get my midwife to rank for these terms, here's the approach I'd take. I'd have her list herself in Yelp, Angie's list, and City Search. I'd work on a few other citations to help her rank for Google's local search results. In addition, I'd have her create some content on Amazon around midwives and homebirthing, maybe a book list or two. And I'd definitely be pulling out my Flip at our next appointment to shoot a video about Phoenix midwives.

Then, I'd work on promoting a few of those pages, especially getting some ratings from past clients on the local listings. And if 7 opportunites to rank for a keyword aren't enough, I'd also have her run some Google ads, cause there weren't that many running.

Now, the only caveat I'd add to all this is...

If you're going to take this approach, I'd make sure to brand each of the pages created on other sites with the same exact name and logo. The reason for this is simple...each time a potential client who's searching for a midwife in Phoenix sees you in the search rankings, it's going to heighten his or her opinion of you. In a sense, it's preselling you based on sheer number of mentions.
