<p>Team Flatterline is now back in Phoenix!</p>

<p>Rather than try to recap the events of the conference, which were too numerous to do any sort of justice, I want to say thanks to all the great people we got to spend time with. If we got a business card from you then we're going to be in contact.... though it might take a few days while we catch up on the sheer volume.</p>

<p>As pictures and media become available I'll post the links here. More likely than not I'll get around to creating an account on Tumblr to keep the Flatterline feed a little more active.</p>
