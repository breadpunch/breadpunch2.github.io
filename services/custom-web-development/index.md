# Custom Web Application Development

At our core, we're custom web application developers. 
You have an idea...we want to build it...
You have a problem...we want to fix it...
You need a custom web app...custom web app development is our specialty... 

We love the thrill of creating new apps...the speed at which we can bring your idea to market...and the reach your custom web application gives you. Since you're in the market for a developer, allow me to share a bit about how we do development...

## Our Development Process

In prehistoric times, you would submit an app idea to a developer. He'd put his head down and go to work coding. Three months later, he'd give you your app and you'd respond with, "What the hell is this?" Cause the idea in your mind isn't anything close to what you received. 

I don't know why anyone would choose to develop this way, but if you talk to other developers about your project, you're sure to run across a few who still think like this. Of course, that's NOT how we do things here...

Taking an idea you have and creating it into an app is an art; an art we excell at. You see, it's all about the communication process, and how we translate your ideas into a living, breathing app. The name for how we do this is: AGILE.

Using agile development methodologies means we adjust to change quickly to create the best product within the time frame and budget alloted. Think of it like a boxer always being on his toes; if you come at the project with a jab, but based on cusomer feedback, realize you need to quickly throw a hook, our agile development strategies allow you to land the punch. And sometimes even two or three for the knockout...

Seriously, you'll be amazed at how much you're going to learn about your business, and your customers, as you go through the development process with us. We're not just going to put our heads down and start coding your app. In fact, it's just the opposite. Read more about our Ruby on Rails development process...
 

##Choosing a Custom Web Application Developer

Do you remember the boxer we were talking about early. Okay, here's how some other developers do things. The bell rings and they throw everything they've got at the guy, regardless of what he's doing, hoping something will land. It's disorganized chaos and there's no synergy for landing the finishing blow. 

What's worse is after the first round, they've got nothing left, and there's still 11 more rounds to go. You can read that as, they develop everything at once, in a disorganized way, and they don't communicate with you about the resutls. In the end, you have an app that doesn't do what you want and no money to make adjustments. Trust us, you don't want to end up like that...

Of course, we want you to choose us to develop your app, but we're not completely naive, we know you're shopping around. In fact, we want you to shop around. But we want you to do it knowledgably, so you can compare apples to oranges (hmmm, are we the apples, or the oranges?).

Because we've gone through this process with so many clients, we have a good idea of the difficulties you face. Not only are you depending on us to develop a high quality application with code that's been tested free of errors, but you're also relying on the application we create to help the success of your business.  Phew...that's a lot of pressure...

I wish we could pull back the face of our client's websites and let you see what's running underneath the surface. Beacuse really, we're not a design company. People don't come to us to make things pretty. What we do is the business logic behind your product or service. It's the process running behind the visual. Things like how a request is processed, who can access information and the enforcement of specific rules you need to make the app work in the most perfect way.

Of course, we could show you some of our code, but what would that mean to you. So you have to rely upon our word that our mad programming skillz are better than those other guys, and we're certain they are. You, on the otherhand, may not be so certain. But to help you, we created this white paper: Top Ten Questions You Should Be Asking Your Web Application Developer

Download it, print it off, sleep with it under your pillow. But whatever you do, make sure you read it, and use the questions when you're shopping around. It'll be our secret *wink, wink*. Now, what's next...?
