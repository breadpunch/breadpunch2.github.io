# Source Code Audit

A source code audit is a great way to understand the investment you've made in your web application.

This helps you determine the quality of your code, expecially if you're not technical, and it's a great place to start when you're switching developers in the middle of a project.

In your source code audit, we check to see if your developers are using a testing suite. If they are, we'll run those tests against your code. We also manually inspect each file to verify Ruby on Rails best practices.  

During the code audit, we don't make any changes to the code. But we provide you with recommendations for changes. Those can be done with us, or with another developer, as a separate project.
