#Source Code Audit

So, you have some code that needs to be checked out. Maybe you started your project with another development team that left you high and dry. Or maybe you just need a 3rd party evaluation of your source code in order to see just how good your developers are. Whatever the case, we're happy to provide you with a quality source code audit to determine the state of your existing code.

In your source code audit, we'll check to see if your developers have a testing suite. If they do, we'll run those tests against your code. If there isn't a testing suite, that's a red flag about the state of your code. We will also manually inspect each file to verify Ruby on Rails best practices.  

During the code audit, we don't make any changes to the code. We will provide you with recommendations for changes. Those could be done with us, or another developer, as a separate project. 

Our code audits are billed hourly, and we generally recommend 6-10 hours for a complete code audit. Contact us today to get things rolling.
