# Ruby on Rails Updates

If you have an application that was built on Rails a few years back, chances are you're in need of a rails update. The problem is, updating could take some finesse so your app doesn't break. With over 10 years of coding experience, our Ruby on Rails programmer will be able to help you update your existing app.

The latest Rails update is from 2 to 3. Rails 3 offers more security features, unobtrusive javascript, and cleaner source code.

Updating from Rails 2 to 3 won't require us to rewrite large portions of your application. But it will help to eliminate the deprecated code, which should be done sooner than later, especially if you're looking at continuing to make changes or release new funcionality on your existing application.

Give us a call today, we promise it won't cost an arm and a leg, just your firstborn to get us to upgrade your rails application.
