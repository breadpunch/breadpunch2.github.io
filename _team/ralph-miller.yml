  guru. By attaining the secrets of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>
  and mastering the art of <abbr title="Search Engine Marketing">SEM</abbr>,
  Ralph has worked on over 80 Internet marketing campaigns and helped
  several Fortune 500 companies propel their sites to the top of the
  search engines.


  In addition to being an <a href="http://www.semmys.org/2010/reputation-management-2010-winner/">award winning writer</a>,

  business to create great content, earn (not build) quality backlinks, and
  achieve higher search engine ranking.


  Oh yeah, he does have a formal education (read as MBA). But we all know what
  that and two dollars will buy you at a coffeeshop... that's right... a cup of
  green tea (his drink of choice when coworking in Phoenix).
